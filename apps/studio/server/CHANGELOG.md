# @codaco/studio-server

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Distinguish the two topologies one Studio artifact serves. `STUDIO_DEPLOYMENT_MODE` (`managed` | `self-hosted`, unset ⇒ `self-hosted`) selects which URL paths a deployment has, from a classification shared by both deployables: the managed-only marketing, pricing, sign-up and billing paths are refused with a real HTTP 404 on a self-hosted instance, and first-run `/setup` is refused on the managed service, so no tenant reaches instance configuration. The refusal still returns the app shell, so the client renders its branded not-found state behind an honest status line, and `Cache-Control: no-store` keeps nothing caching it. `/` is served in both, because a self-hoster's origin root is the URL they hand their researchers. The `status` procedure now reports the mode, and the static-asset wiring moves out of the server entrypoint into `mountClient`.
- Researchers can have a language preference stored on their account, so the
  language they choose follows them to any device they sign in on rather than
  living only in the browser that set it.

  The preference is optional: an account that has never chosen one has no
  stored value, and the interface falls back to the languages the browser asks
  for. Only languages Studio actually supports can be stored.

- Put real numbers on the study sidebar's countable destinations, so a researcher
  can see how much is in a study without opening each screen to find out.
  Versions, Participants, Waves and Sessions each carry the count the app-shell
  design gives them, read from the study's own rows through a new
  `studies.counts` procedure: one query, addressed by the study alone and
  refused for exactly the studies its reader could not open, so the four
  numbers are always describing the same study at the same moment.

  A count is a claim, and an unchecked one is worse than none. Until the answer
  arrives — and if it never does, because the read failed — the rows render
  exactly as they did before, with no number at all. A
  study with nothing in it is left unnumbered for the same reason: "Participants"
  reads better than "Participants 0", and neither is ever invented on the
  client's behalf.

  API tokens in the account area gets no count. Tokens are owned by a team and
  answerable to a custodian, so "how many are mine" is not a question the data
  model can answer, and a number that quietly meant "this team's tokens" would be
  the wrong answer rather than a missing one.

- Add protected operational metrics, bounded dependency readiness, and structured request diagnostics that omit research payloads and secrets. Correlate HTTP responses with immutable audit events using validated request IDs.
- Studio's database now carries its whole decided data model rather than only teams and protocols: studies with their waves, participants, interview sessions and links, the collected network (nodes, edges, snapshots and per-session rollups), study roles, consent, scheduling and messaging, team-owned API tokens, asset metadata, templates, webhooks, experiments, feedback, monitoring rollups, and the audit log's staged exports and alert outbox — 32 new tables, every one team-scoped under forced row-level security with the closed-study, finalized-session and participant-erasure rules enforced by database triggers. A fresh Studio instance now seeds itself with synthetic demo data across that model instead of an empty database: a handful of teams with members across every role, studies in every lifecycle state with realistic interview networks, and a fixed admin account (`admin@studio.test` / `studio-admin-not-for-production`) that owns every seeded team and holds a Manager grant on every seeded study. Email/password is now a full third sign-in method alongside magic-link and social — the sign-in screen offers a password form (toggling with magic-link when both are available), and the server accepts it through the real `/api/auth/sign-in/email` endpoint. `pnpm dev` resets and reseeds the database on every boot; the deploy-time `seed` command does the same against any target, refusing a non-local database unless `--force` makes that explicit, matching `db:reset` — and both refuse to give a non-local database the published admin password, taking `STUDIO_SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` instead.
- Studio's study picker now lists and creates real studies instead of protocols. `/team/$teamId` shows each study with its lifecycle state, its participation mode and its wave and participant counts, and creating one writes the study and its protocol line together in a single transaction — so every study has something to design, and the creator receives the study's first Manager grant. Who sees what follows the decided role model: a team Admin or Owner sees every study their team owns, and a team Member sees only the studies they hold a study role on; creating a study is an Admin or Owner action, and a refusal is recorded in the team's activity log alongside the creation itself. A `/study/…` link now opens the study it names from any starting point — the server works out which team owns it from the study identifier alone, rather than the browser having to know, so a bookmark or a shared link opens correctly on a first sign-in that has no team selected yet. The header's study chip names the study instead of showing its identifier and offers the team's other studies, and the protocol editor reaches its draft through the study's protocol rather than treating the study identifier as a protocol identifier.
- Let team owners and admins observe their team's immutable activity record: a permission-checked audit.list/audit.get RPC surface with sequence-cursor pagination and server-rendered event titles, and a team activity screen with category, action, actor, outcome, and date filters, Load more pagination, and an accessible per-event detail view. Members are denied with a committed, rate-limited audit.read_denied event, and events recorded by a newer Studio version render through a safe generic presentation.
- The header's two bespoke switchers are replaced by the shared
  `TeamAndStudySwitcher`, so the team and the study read as one path rather than
  as two controls that happen to sit beside each other.

  The team shown is the one the URL names, falling back to the active-team
  setting only where no route names a team, so the header cannot announce the
  team a researcher is leaving — and that fallback is resolved through the
  membership list, so a setting that outlived its membership names nothing
  rather than offering to administer a team the researcher has left. A team list
  that fails while an earlier one is still in hand goes on offering that one.
  Choosing the team already current does nothing. A researcher who belongs to no
  team gets no segment at all, and a loading list shows a skeleton rather than
  reflowing the header.

  Reporting a team list that could not be read at all belongs to the shell, not
  to the switcher, which shows what it was given and nothing about why.

  The study segment is absent, not empty, on routes that open no study.

  Everything it shows is real. Each study carries its lifecycle state and how
  much of it there is — "Live · 2 waves · 14 participants" — with a dot coloured
  by that state, and the state is in the trigger's accessible name too, so it
  never rests on colour alone. Each team carries the researcher's role in it.
  A study whose team cannot be resolved is named by its identifier and offered
  no siblings, which is what the shell honestly knows about it.

  `me` carries the caller's memberships now — every team they belong to, and
  their role in it — which is why `@codaco/studio-rpc` and
  `@codaco/studio-server` are versioned alongside the client. Better Auth's own
  team list joins the member table and then returns only the organization, so
  nothing else could tell the switcher what a researcher is in each of their
  teams. The role travels as a plain string rather than the role enum, because
  a legacy membership is stored as one comma-separated value and an enum would
  fail the whole response over it.

### Patch Changes

- Fix the Netlify deployment answering every request with the client's "server could not be reached" screen. The lane is documented to run with no database and auth off, because a deploy preview's per-PR origin can never match PUBLIC_URL — but that rested on the Netlify site not defining DATABASE_URL, which nothing enforced. With a database configured but unusable from the function, better-auth failed the session lookup with a 500 and the CSRF gate refused the preview's own requests. The Netlify entrypoint now drops both surfaces itself, so the documented degradation is what runs: sign-in reports that it is unavailable on this server instead of the app replacing itself with an error screen.
- Keep application and background database connections on their intended roles when database URLs include startup options. Preserve connection settings and refuse a client whose actual role does not match before any application query runs.
- Centralize background delivery retries, lease renewal, and operational measurements while preserving invitation delivery safeguards.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the first Studio protocol editor foundation: team-scoped protocol creation and draft opening, an accessible outline/canvas/inspector shell, leased screen editing with validation and undo/redo, and shared client-safe protocol section and session contracts.
- Record team administration and current protocol mutations in a transactionally immutable, team-isolated audit log, route those Studio commands through the audited transaction boundary, and complete the invitation lifecycle with transactional email delivery and audited acceptance.
- Postgres row-level security now enforces the team boundary beneath the data layer. Every tenant table carries a `team_isolation` policy keyed on the transaction-local team id the team-pinned database handle already stamps, and row-level security is forced so no owner exemption applies: a statement that omits its team predicate sees no rows, and a write aimed at another team is refused. The schema apply creates two `NOLOGIN` roles, `studio_app` and `studio_maintenance`, and grants the connecting login the right to assume them; the server's pool starts every session as `studio_app`, which cannot bypass policies, while garbage collection runs as `studio_maintenance`, the one role the policies admit across teams — and refuses to run as anything else. The single `DATABASE_URL` is unchanged, but the login it names must hold `CREATEROLE` the first time the schema is applied.
- Teams are now the tenant boundary throughout Studio's data layer. Every domain row — protocols, versions, drafts, sections, manifests, leases, and the command log — carries a team id pinned by composite foreign keys, and section documents deduplicate per team so content never crosses the boundary. The sync engine and protocol store operate only through a team-pinned database handle (`@codaco/studio-sync/tenant`), and the RPC contract gains the first team-scoped procedures, `protocols.create` and `protocols.list`, authorized per request against the caller's team membership. Deleting a team is refused until a tenant-purge path exists: no delete of a team row could remove the sync-side rows that name it.
