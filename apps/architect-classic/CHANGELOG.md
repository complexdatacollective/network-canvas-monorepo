## 6.6.3

- **Fixed a crash when editing stages.** Adding or opening a stage whose editor shows option
  cards (for example a Sociogram's background and layout mode) stopped with "Something went
  wrong. jsx is not defined". A broken release of a supporting library has been replaced, and
  these editors open normally again.
- **Fixed "Download Sample Protocol".** Downloading the sample protocol always failed with
  "Buffer is not defined". It now downloads, saves to the location you choose, and opens.
- **Fixed a path traversal weakness when importing protocols.** Importing a protocol file
  (`.netcanvas`) used a ZIP extraction library with a known flaw: a specially crafted archive
  could write files outside the folder it was being unpacked into. It has been replaced with a
  maintained library that refuses these archives. Protocol files that contain links pointing
  outside their own folder, or repeated file names, now fail to import instead of being
  unpacked; ordinary protocols are unaffected.
- **Updated Electron to 43.7.** This brings in the Chromium and Node.js fixes shipped since
  Electron 43.0, including several security fixes for sandboxing and cross-origin file access.
- **Fixed out-of-date results appearing in variable and asset lists.** When the data source for
  a field changed quickly, a slow response for the old source could overwrite the newer one.
  Only the latest request is used now.
- **More reliable macOS signing.** The build tooling (electron-builder 26.16) unlocks the
  signing keychain correctly, so macOS builds are signed and notarized consistently.
- **Internal improvements.** Many editor panels (the variable picker, form sections, date
  picker, sociogram prompt settings and others) now derive their state while rendering instead
  of in a delayed update. Behaviour is unchanged.

## 6.6.2

- **Fixed the variable picker opening behind the field editor.** Clicking "Select Variable" or
  "Change Variable" in a form field editor appeared to do nothing because the variable picker
  was being drawn underneath the field editor. It now opens above it, as it did in earlier
  versions.
- **Fixed oversized node previews in the entity select field.** Node previews in the entity
  select field editor were rendered at full interview size instead of the smaller preview size.
  They are now shown at the intended size again.

## 6.6.1

- **Fixed a crash on launch.** Version 6.6.0 could fail to start with a "Cannot find module
  'readable-stream/passthrough'" error, caused by required dependency files being left out of
  the packaged app. The app now starts correctly, and protocol import/export functionality
  affected by the same packaging issue has been restored.

## 6.6.0

- **Updated core dependencies.** The technology the app is built on has been brought up to
  date, which improves stability and performance and lays the groundwork for future
  improvements.
- **Compatibility with upcoming macOS versions.** This release ensures the app continues to
  run smoothly on the latest and upcoming versions of macOS.
- **Improved security.** We've adopted current security best practices for building and
  distributing the app — including properly signed and notarized macOS builds — so you can be
  confident the software you download is genuine and safe to run.
