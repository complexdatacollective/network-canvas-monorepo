				Dyad Census prompts explain to your participant which relationship they should evaluate (for example,
				&apos;friendship&apos;, &apos;material support&apos; or &apos;conflict&apos;). Enter prompt text below, and
				select an edge type that will be created when the participant answers &apos;yes&apos;.
			</p>
			<Tip type="info">
				<p>
					Remember to write your prompt text to take into account that the participant will be looking at pairs of
					prompts in sequence. Use phrases such as &apos;
					<strong>these people</strong>
					&apos;, or &apos;
					<strong>the two people shown</strong>
					&apos; to indicate that the participant should focus on the visible pair.
				</p>
				<p>
					You should also phrase your prompt so that it can be answered with either a &apos;yes&apos; or a
					&apos;no&apos; by the participant, since these are the user-interface options that are shown.
