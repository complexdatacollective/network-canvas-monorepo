# Phase 1 Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Redux Store Refactoring
- ✅ Created `protocols.ts` module to store all opened/created protocols
- ✅ Created `activeProtocol.ts` module to represent the currently active protocol
- ✅ Updated root reducer to include both old and new modules (for transition)
- ✅ Implemented protocol ID generation using SHA-256 hash of protocol JSON

### 2. Routing Updates
- ✅ Added support for `/protocol/:protocolId` route parameter
- ✅ Created `useProtocolLoader` hook to handle URL-based protocol loading
- ✅ Kept legacy `/protocol` route for backwards compatibility during transition

### 3. Web-Based Protocol Management
- ✅ Created `webUserActions.ts` with browser-based file operations
- ✅ Implemented file upload via browser File API
- ✅ Implemented protocol export as downloadable file
- ✅ Updated save functionality to work with Redux store (no filesystem)

### 4. Component Updates
- ✅ Updated `LaunchPad` to use new protocols store and navigation
- ✅ Updated `ProtocolStack` to navigate by protocol ID
- ✅ Updated `Protocol` component to use protocol loader hook
- ✅ Updated `ProtocolControlBar` to use new actions and navigation
- ✅ Created new TypeScript protocol selectors with dual-store support

### 5. Migration Support
- ✅ Created migration utilities to convert old format to new
- ✅ Added automatic migration on store initialization
- ✅ Preserved backwards compatibility during transition

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Component Updates
- [ ] Update remaining components that use protocol/recentProtocols
- [ ] Update components that use session actions
- [ ] Update all import statements to use new modules

### 2. Testing
- [ ] Write tests for new Redux modules
- [ ] Write tests for protocol loading and navigation
- [ ] Write tests for migration logic

### 3. Cleanup (after testing)
- [ ] Remove old `recentProtocols.ts` module
- [ ] Remove old `protocol.ts` module
- [ ] Remove old `session.js` module
- [ ] Remove legacy action types and backwards compatibility code
- [ ] Update all imports to use new modules exclusively

## Key Architecture Changes

1. **Protocol Storage**: Full protocol data now stored in Redux instead of file references
2. **Protocol IDs**: Using content-based hashes for consistent IDs
3. **Navigation**: URL-based routing with protocol IDs (`/protocol/{id}`)
4. **File Operations**: Browser-based file upload/download instead of filesystem access
5. **State Management**: Clear separation between all protocols (`protocols`) and active protocol (`activeProtocol`)

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining component updates
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Remove old modules and clean up code
4. Begin Phase 2 planning for removing modal/overlay system
