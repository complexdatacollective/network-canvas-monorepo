# @codaco/background-creator

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 88f4d4b: A long attribute name no longer pushes the rest of the codebook table off
  screen. The name is cut short with an ellipsis, and the full name is still in
  its tooltip.

  The printed protocol summary shows stored values exactly as they are saved,
  instead of breaking them across lines with hyphens. The summary page also has
  the same margin at the edges as the Codebook and Resource Library pages.

  On a phone, the list of interfaces for a new stage now fits the screen, and
  every title and description can be read.

  A video preview keeps its playback controls inside the window.

  While you edit a choice value, its confirm button is now the same size as the
  delete button beside it.

  When you create an attribute on the Codebook page and choose its type, the
  values it needs now scroll into view instead of appearing below the window's
  visible area.

  When a toolbar is too narrow for all its buttons, it now fades the edge where
  more buttons are hidden, so it is clear the toolbar can be scrolled. This
  includes the Background Creator toolbar. The toolbar at the bottom of
  Architect's screen also scrolls to show its last button, such as Download.

  `SegmentedToolbar` has a new `restAt` prop. Set it to `"end"` to show a
  toolbar's last button, rather than its first, when the toolbar does not fit.

  A field's error message now has space between it and the control above it,
  instead of sitting right against it.

  `ScrollArea` now fades the correct edges when it scrolls sideways in a
  right-to-left language.

- 64c7891: `Badge` is now the one label chip, replacing three overlapping components that
  rendered the same kind of object differently depending on which one a call site
  happened to pick.

  `Badge` gains semantic `tone`s (`neutral`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`,
  `info`, `success`, `warning`, `destructive`), each painted in a `filled` or
  `outline` `appearance` from the theme's colour pairs so it follows light and
  dark mode; three sizes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`); `mono` and `uppercase` typography
  options; a leading `icon` slot; the palette `color` prop for taxonomic
  colouring; and a Base UI `render` override for rendering as a button, toggle
  or animated element. Its default look is unchanged.

  `Tag` keeps its name, API and look but is now a `Badge` with a toggle state
  and palette dot, so the two can no longer drift.

  **Breaking:** `Pill` and the `@codaco/fresco-ui/Pill` subpath are removed —
  use `Badge` with `mono` (and `appearance="outline"` for the outlined look).
  `Badge`'s `variant` prop is replaced by `tone` and `appearance`:
  `variant="secondary"` → `tone="secondary"`, `variant="destructive"` →
  `tone="destructive"`, `variant="outline"` → `appearance="outline"`; the
  default needs no props.

  The interview runtime's offline map banner; Architect's codebook usage chips, library counts, asset cards and the
  requires-internet label on protocol cards; Interviewer's deck card label;
  Background Creator's zone pills; and Fresco's activity feed, interview,
  participant and passkey chips all render through it.

## 1.0.0

### Patch Changes

- 86e2c00: Introduce Network Canvas Background Creator — a browser-based editor for
  designing sociogram background images and the position-generation scripts that
  pair with them.

  Draw rectangles, ellipses, lines, polygons, and text on a canvas sized to your
  interview screen, mark shapes as named zones, and export a responsive SVG
  background together with an R or Python script that sorts participant
  coordinates into those zones. Backgrounds adapt to light and dark themes and
  reopen losslessly for further editing.
