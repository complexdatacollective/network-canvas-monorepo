# Authentication Implementation Summary

This document describes the authentication system implementation for the Fresco Platform.

## Overview

The Fresco Platform uses **Better Auth** for authentication, integrated with React Query for state management and Next.js App Router for routing.

## Components Created

### 1. Login Page (`/apps/fresco-platform/src/app/login/page.tsx`)

A fully functional login page featuring:

- **Email/password authentication** using React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **"Remember me" checkbox** for persistent sessions
- **Password visibility toggle** with eye icon
- **Error handling** for invalid credentials
- **Redirect support** - preserves intended destination after login
- **Link to signup** for new users
- **Link to forgot password** (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Loading states** during authentication
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS

**Key Features:**
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- Automatic redirect to dashboard or intended page after successful login
- Query parameter support for redirect URLs (`?redirect=/dashboard/applications`)
- Accessibility features (proper labels, ARIA attributes)

### 2. Auth Guard Component (`/apps/fresco-platform/src/components/auth/auth-guard.tsx`)

A reusable authentication wrapper that:

- **Checks for valid session** using the `useSession` hook
- **Redirects to login** if user is not authenticated
- **Shows loading state** while verifying authentication
- **Preserves intended route** for post-login redirect
- **Supports custom fallback** for loading state

**Usage:**
```tsx
<AuthGuard>
  <ProtectedContent />
</AuthGuard>
```

### 3. Dashboard Layout Updates (`/apps/fresco-platform/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)

Enhanced with authentication:

- **Wrapped with AuthGuard** - all dashboard routes now require authentication
- **Integrated with React Query** for session management
- **Automatic redirect** to login for unauthenticated users

### 4. Dashboard Header Updates (`/apps/fresco-platform/src/components/dashboard/dashboard-header.tsx`)

Enhanced with user information:

- **User menu dropdown** showing current user name and email
- **Settings link** for user preferences
- **Sign out button** with confirmation
- **Profile icon** in header
- **Keyboard navigation support** (Escape to close)
- **Accessible menu** with proper ARIA labels

**User Menu Features:**
- Displays user name and email
- Link to settings page
- Sign out functionality
- Click outside to close
- Keyboard support (Escape key)

### 5. Forgot Password Page (`/apps/fresco-platform/src/app/forgot-password/page.tsx`)

A placeholder page for future password reset functionality:

- Informs users the feature is coming soon
- Provides link back to login
- Maintains consistent design with other auth pages

## Scripts and Tools

### Setup Script (`/apps/fresco-platform/scripts/setup.ts`)

A comprehensive setup script that:

1. **Checks environment variables** - validates all required config
2. **Verifies Docker is running** - ensures Docker daemon is accessible
3. **Tests PostgreSQL connection** - confirms database is available
4. **Creates Docker network** - sets up network for Fresco containers
5. **Initializes database** - generates Prisma client and pushes schema
6. **Provides helpful feedback** - colored output with clear error messages

**Features:**
- Colored terminal output for better readability
- Clear error messages with solutions
- Step-by-step progress indication
- Graceful failure handling
- Helpful suggestions when things go wrong

**Usage:**
```bash
pnpm setup
```

### Package.json Scripts

Added two new scripts:

- **`setup`** - Runs the setup script to initialize the platform
- **`dev:all`** - Runs setup then starts the dev server

## Configuration Files

### Environment Variables (`.env.example`)

Created a comprehensive example environment file with:

- Database configuration
- App URLs
- Docker settings
- Better Auth configuration
- Fresco image settings
- Development mode flags

**Important Security Notes:**
- `AUTH_SECRET` must be changed in production
- Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Never commit actual `.env.local` to version control

## Documentation

### Setup Instructions (`/SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md`)

Comprehensive documentation including:

1. **Prerequisites** - required software and versions
2. **Quick Start Guide** - step-by-step setup process
3. **Testing the Full Flow** - how to verify everything works
4. **Common Issues** - troubleshooting guide with solutions
5. **Development Scripts** - all available commands
6. **Database Management** - Prisma Studio, backups, resets
7. **Architecture Overview** - auth flow and deployment process
8. **Production Deployment** - security and configuration checklist

## Authentication Flow

### Sign Up Flow

1. User visits `/signup`
2. Completes multi-step wizard (email, password, use case, subdomain, etc.)
3. Account created via Better Auth
4. User automatically signed in
5. Redirected to deployment success page
6. Can navigate to dashboard

### Sign In Flow

1. User visits `/login` or is redirected from protected route
2. Enters email and password
3. Form validated client-side
4. Credentials submitted to Better Auth
5. Session created on success
6. User redirected to dashboard or original intended route

### Protected Route Access

1. User navigates to protected route (e.g., `/dashboard`)
2. `AuthGuard` component checks for session via `useSession` hook
3. If authenticated: content renders normally
4. If not authenticated: redirect to `/login?redirect=/dashboard`
5. After login: user redirected back to `/dashboard`

### Sign Out Flow

1. User clicks profile icon in header
2. Clicks "Sign out" in dropdown menu
3. `useSignOut` hook called
4. Better Auth invalidates session
5. React Query cache cleared
6. User redirected to `/login`

## Session Management

### React Query Integration

The authentication system uses React Query for:

- **Session caching** - 5-minute stale time
- **Automatic invalidation** - after sign in/out
- **Loading states** - managed by useQuery
- **Error handling** - centralized error states

### Hooks Available

All hooks are in `/apps/fresco-platform/src/hooks/use-auth.ts`:

- **`useSignIn()`** - Sign in with email/password
- **`useSignUp()`** - Create new account
- **`useSignOut()`** - End session
- **`useSession()`** - Get current session
- **`useCurrentUser()`** - Get current user data
- **`useUpdateProfile()`** - Update user information
