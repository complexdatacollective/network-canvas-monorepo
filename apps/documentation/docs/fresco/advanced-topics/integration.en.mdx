title: Integration with other survey tools
date: 13th August 2024

As with _Interviewer_, Fresco is not intended to replace existing general purpose survey tools - particularly for ego specific data collection. We suggest that extensive ego-level data collection is done using a general purpose survey tool, and that Fresco is used to collect network data. 

To facilitate this, Fresco supports integration with other survey tools via shared tokens, called "participant identifiers", which can be passed from your conventional survey tool into Fresco.

This integration will allow your participants to complete a "conventional" survey and then seamlessly transition to the network portion of the interview in Fresco simply by clicking a link. The data collected in Fresco can then be associated to the survey data using the shared participant identifier when conducting your analysis.

This article will explain the process of integrating using Qualtrics as an example, but the process is similar for other survey tools. Please let us know if you would like to see additional documentation for other survey tools.

## What is a Participant identifier?

In Fresco, every participant in your study must have a unique identifier. When creating participants manually, you must provide this identifier yourself (or use the dedicated button to randomly generate one). When anonymous recruitment is enabled, this identifier will be generated as a participant is created using the anonymous participation URL, or (as we will see later in this tutorial) can be provided as part of the URL.

<Tipbox danger>
Participant identifiers are sometimes used in URLs that are shared with participants, and are therefore potentially visible to them. Because of this, they <strong>must not contain sensitive information, and must not be easy for other participants to guess</strong> (e.g. sequential numbers, or easily guessable strings). 
</Tipbox>

## How Integration Works

<Tipbox>
It is <em>not</em> currently possible to pass data from Fresco back to the survey tool. This is a one-way integration.
</Tipbox>

As mentioned previously, the ultimate aim of integration is to be able to have your participant take a "conventional" survey, and then have them click a link that takes them to the network portion of the interview. By itself this would be simple to implement, but the key is to be able to link the data collected in the survey tool back to the data collected in Fresco.

Put simply, this is achieved by embedding the participant identifier in the URL that is used to link to the Fresco interview. When present in a URL, Fresco will use this identifier to either create a new participant (if anonymous recruitment is enabled) with the given identifier, or will link to an existing participant, before launching the interview. 

There are two ways that the identifier can be included in the onboarding URL:

### Query Parameters

The participant identifier can be included within what are known as "query parameters". This is a standardized web technology that encodes groups of data and labels in the format `label=value`, separated by ampersands (`&`) and added to the end of a URL following a question mark character (`?`). For example, a search engine may use query parameters to store a search query like this: `http://google.com?query=networkcanvas`.

In Fresco, the query parameter must be named `participantIdentifier` (this is case-sensitive!), and should be appended to the onboarding URL for your protocol. An example onboarding URL with the participant identifier included as a query parameter might look like:
  
```plaintext
https://yourstudy.com/onboard/{protocolID}/?participantIdentifier=12345
```

Using query parameters is the simplest method, but the participant identifier will be visible in the URL and could be tampered with.

### POST Parameters

The participant identifier can also be included in the body of a POST request. This is a more secure method, as the data is not visible in the URL, but it is more complex to implement.

Fresco will look at the body of a POST request and try to parse it as JSON. If it finds a key called `participantIdentifier`, it will use the value of that key as the participant identifier.

This guide will focus on the query parameter method, as it is simpler to implement and should be sufficient for most use cases.

## Example integration with Qualtrics

As an example, we will now discuss how to implement this process in [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com), assuming that you do not have a pre-existing list of participants. The process is similar for other survey tools, but the exact steps may vary.

<Tipbox>

We will be working on the assumption that you have already set up your Fresco instance and created/uploaded an interview protocol. If you have not done this, please refer to the [deployment documentation](../deployment/guide) for instructions on how to do so.

</Tipbox>

### Set up your Fresco instance to allow anonymous recruitment.

Anonymous recruitment will allow participants to join your study without you needing to add them to Fresco in advance. This simplifies the process for the sake of this example, since it means you do not have to synchronize participant lists between Fresco and your survey tool. It is possible to integrate with external tools without anonymous recruitment enabled, but there are no real advantages to doing so.

To turn on the anonymous recruitment feature, log in to your Fresco instance, and go to the "settings" tab in the top navigation bar. Toggle the switch in the anonymous recruitment section to the "on" position.

Navigate to the "protocols" page, and click the button under the "Anonymous Participation URL" column next to the protocol you want to use. This will copy the anonymous participation URL to your clipboard. Paste this into a text editor for referencing later. It should look something like: `https://your-fresco-instance.com/onboard/clwak4fc70000pybyrk9rvb98`.

### Set up your Qualtrics survey to generate or collect an identifier

Create your survey in Qualtrics to your specifications. 

You will need to generate a unique identifier for each participant that you want to pass to Fresco. This could be:

- a randomly generated code
- a combination of answers to survey questions (e.g., a participant's initials and date of birth)
- an ID defined in an external data file that you uploaded to Qualtrics
- the Qualtrics Response ID (a unique identifier automatically assigned to each response)

For details on how to generate a unique identifier in Qualtrics, consult the [Qualtrics support documentation](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/).

For the purposes of this example, we will use the Qualtrics Response ID, which is a unique identifier automatically assigned to each survey response. 

### Use piped text to pass the identifier to Fresco

To pass the identifier, we will use the ["piped text"](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/piped-text/piped-text-overview/) feature in Qualtrics. This allows you to insert dynamic data into your survey questions and responses, or as in this case, into the URL that you will use to link to Fresco.

In your survey screen find the **"End of Survey"** block:

![End of Survey](/assets/img/fresco-images/end-of-survey.png)

Edit the **"End of Survey"** block to add a link to your Fresco survey with the "anonymous participation URL" you pasted into your text editor earlier.

Update the link to include the piped text code for your identifier. In this example, we will use the Qualtrics Response ID as the identifier. The Response ID is a unique identifier automatically generated by Qualtrics for each survey response. The piped text code for the Response ID is `${e://Field/ResponseID}`. We add this code to the URL as a query parameter named `participantIdentifier`, which results in the following:

```html
You have completed the first part of the study. Click the link below to proceed
to the next section:

<a
  href="https://your-fresco-instance.com/onboard/clwak4fc70000pybyrk9rvb98/?participantIdentifier=${e://Field/ResponseID}"
>
  Continue to the next section
</a>
```

<Tipbox>

**Understanding Qualtrics piped text prefixes:** Qualtrics uses different prefixes to access different types of data:

- **`e://`** - Used to access embedded data fields and built-in response fields like `ResponseID`. This is the most common prefix for standard survey workflows.
- **`l://`** - Used specifically within "Loop and Merge" contexts to access fields from the current loop iteration.

If you are using Loop and Merge functionality in your survey and need to pass an identifier from within a loop, you would use `${l://FieldName}` instead. For most standard survey setups, `e://` is the correct choice.

</Tipbox>

The link _must_ be in the format shown to ensure that the participant identifier is passed correctly. Test the link by clicking on it to ensure that it leads to your Fresco survey, and creates a new participant with the correct identifier.

<Tipbox>

You can test the Fresco interview link with a dummy participant identifier to ensure that it creates a new participant in your Fresco participants page and a dedicated interview with the passed identifier.

Simply replace the participant identifier in the URL with a test identifier. For example, if your Fresco instance URL is **`https://your-fresco-instance.com/onboard/clwak4fc70000pybyrk9rvb98`** and you want to test the link with the identifier **`Test123`**, the URL should look like this:

```plaintext
https://your-fresco-instance.com/onboard/clwak4fc70000pybyrk9rvb98/?participantIdentifier=Test123
```

</Tipbox>

Assuming that the test was successful, you can now distribute your survey to participants. When they complete the survey, they will be directed to the Fresco interview with the participant identifier in Fresco corresponding to the Response ID in Qualtrics.

## Additional Considerations

- You can prevent more than one interview being submitted with the same identifier, using the **"LIMIT INTERVIEWS"** option in Fresco settings page. This ensures that each participant can only submit one interview per identifier.
