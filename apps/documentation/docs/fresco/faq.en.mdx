## How much does Fresco cost?

Fresco is free and open source software. You can always 
download the latest version of Fresco source-code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/fresco).

We have done our best to make sure that you can deploy Fresco on your own server (if you have one) or to a cloud platform like Netlify
without any additional costs. However, you may need to pay for server hosting, depending on your needs.

Our [Deployment Guide](./deployment/guide) covers getting started with deploying Fresco
using the free tier of Netlify, which is sufficient for most small-scale research projects. 

Netlify also offers paid plans with greater features and performance. Information about the costs of using Netlify can be found on their [pricing page](https://netlify.com/pricing).

Our [advanced deployment guide](./deployment/advanced) covers deploying Fresco on your own server, which may require additional costs depending on your server provider.

## How do I get support for Fresco?

We do not offer direct support for Fresco, nor do we have a dedicated support team. However, we are always happy to help you with any questions or issues you may have. You can reach out to us on our [User Community](https://community.networkcanvas.com/). You can also use the feedback mechanism within Fresco to contact us.

If you would like to work more closely with the project team as part of a research collaboration, please contact us at [info@networkcanvas.com](mailto:info@networkcanvas.com).

## What are the requirements for deploying Fresco?

Fresco is a web application that requires a server to host it. You can deploy Fresco on your own server or use a cloud platform like Netlify. The [Deployment Guide](./deployment/guide) provides detailed instructions on how to deploy Fresco on Netlify, for free.

The core technology stack for Fresco is as follows:
  - Frontend: Next.js (React)
  - Backend:
    - Node 20+ - for running the backend server
    - Next.js API routes - for handling API requests
    - tRPC - for defining and handling API routes
    - PostgreSQL - for storing all data
    - Prisma - for interacting with the database
    - UploadThing - for storing protocol assets

To deploy Fresco, you will need to have access to one or more servers that can run these technologies. For example you might have a server that runs the Next.js frontend and another server that runs the PostgreSQL database.

Advanced users can refer to the [advanced deployment guide](./deployment/advanced) for more information on deploying Fresco on their own server.

## How do I set up a custom domain for my Fresco deployment?

Setting up a custom domain for your Fresco deployment will depend on how you have deployed Fresco. If you are using Netlify, you can follow the instructions in the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/manage/domains/get-started-with-domains/).

If you are using a different deployment method, you will need to follow the instructions for that specific method.

## How do I update Fresco to the latest version?

You can update Fresco to the latest version by following the instructions in the [Upgrade Guide](./deployment/upgrading).

## How do I backup my data?

The specific steps for backing up your data will depend on how you have deployed Fresco. If you are using Neon, you can follow the instructions in the [Neon backups documentation](https://neon.com/docs/manage/backups).

If you are using a different database provider, you will need to follow the backup procedures for the specific technologies you are using.

## Is the data storage HIPAA/GDPR compliant? Is it secure?

Fresco is designed to be self-hosted, which means that you have full control over the data storage and security. You can deploy Fresco on your own server or use a cloud platform like Netlify. If you are using a cloud platform, you should review their security and compliance documentation to ensure that it meets your needs.

## Why can I only create a single user account?

Fresco is designed to be used by a single user. This is because the platform is intended for small-scale research projects where a single researcher is responsible for managing the data collection process. If you need to share access with a colleague, you can share your login credentials with them.

We have plans for more sophisticated multi-user and multi-project support in the forthcoming Studio platform. 

## Where will announcements about releases be posted?

New versions of Fresco will be announced on our <a href="https://community.networkcanvas.com/" target="_blank">User Community</a>. More information about the upgrade process can be found in the [Upgrade Guide](./deployment/upgrading).

## Which browsers are supported?

Fresco is supported on latest version of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. This applies to the backend user dashboard and the participant interview experience.

We specifically do not support Internet Explorer or Edge Legacy.

If you encounter an issue with a supported browser, or if you need a specific version of a browser to be supported, please use the feedback mechanism within Fresco to contact us.

## Which devices and platforms are supported for participants?

Participants can use any computer or tablet with a supported browser for interviews. Smartphones or small-screen devices are not compatible. Tablets should be used in landscape mode for optimal viewing during interviews.

## How do I create another user account for my colleague?

Only one user account can be created in Fresco. If you need to share access with a colleague, you can share your login credentials with them. We reccomend using a shared username and password for the administrator account to ensure that your team can access the platform.

## How do I reset my password?

The short answer is that you cannot reset your password in Fresco, because implementing a password recovery feature would have required additional deployment steps and configuration. Please make sure to keep your login credentials so that you do not lose access to the platform.

If you have lost your login credentials, what you can will depend on if you have access to your database.

If you _do_ have access to your database, please contact us and we may be able to assist you.

If you do not have access, you may need to [reset your database](/en/fresco/deployment/troubleshooting#instance-expired---reset-your-database). This will result in the loss of all data and unexported interviews.

## I have multiple studies. Should I create a new Fresco instance for each study?

Fresco is designed to be used for a single study at a time. If you have multiple studies, you can create a new Fresco instance for each study. This will allow you to keep the data separate and organized. Please bear in mind that you may need to pay for additional server hosting if you create multiple instances.
