This guide explains how Interviewer and Fresco handle participant data, how they fit within GDPR frameworks, and what responsibilities researchers must take on when deploying them.
</Paragraph>

<TipBox>

This document is **not** a certification of GDPR compliance. Instead, it clarifies what is required to use the software in a compliant manner and explains the responsibilities of researchers as Data Controllers.

</TipBox>

## Purpose of this guide

This guide is designed for researchers, ethics committees, IT departments, and data protection officers who need to understand how Network Canvas tools handle personal data and what measures are needed to ensure GDPR compliance.

**Key Points:**
- The Network Canvas development team does not act as a Data Controller or Data Processor
- No participant data is ever received, transmitted to, or stored by the developers
- Researchers retain full control and responsibility for all participant data
- GDPR compliance is achieved through proper deployment, configuration, and institutional policies

## Roles under GDPR

### Data Controller

The **research institution or individual researcher** deploying the software is always the Data Controller. You determine:

- Why participant data is collected
- Which data is collected
- How long data is stored
- What lawful basis applies under GDPR
- How consent and subject rights are managed
- Where data is hosted and who has access

### Fresco and Interviewer developers

The Network Canvas development team:

- Provides the open-source software
- Does **not** receive or host participant data
- Does **not** monitor researcher use
- Does **not** operate a data processing service

**Therefore, the developers do not act as a Data Processor under GDPR.**

All data processing occurs entirely within infrastructure controlled by the researcher.

## Interviewer (Desktop/Tablet application)

Interviewer is a fully offline application designed to run on researcher-controlled devices.

### Data storage

**All interview data is stored locally on your device:**
- Data resides within the application sandbox on the local filesystem
- Data is exported **only when you manually export it**
- No automatic uploads or transmissions occur

**What this means for GDPR:**
- You have complete control over participant data
- Data residency is determined by the physical location of your device
- No third parties have access to the data through the software

### Network communication

Interviewer performs **minimal network communication**:

**Update check:**
- Queries the GitHub API to check for new versions
- **No participant data or identifiable information is transmitted**
- The request contains only the current version number

**No other network requests:**
- Beyond the update check, Interviewer makes no external connections
- All data processing occurs entirely offline

### Telemetry and third-party services

**Interviewer does not include:**
- Analytics or crash reporting
- External scripts, fonts, or services
- Tracking mechanisms of any kind
- Third-party data processors

### Other stored data

**Application preferences:**
- UI configuration settings are stored locally
- These preferences do **not** contain participant data
- They cannot be used to identify participants

### Encryption and device security

**Important:** Interviewer does not perform internal encryption of its stored data.

**Your responsibilities:**
- Enable device-level encryption (FileVault on macOS, BitLocker on Windows, device encryption on mobile)
- Implement secure device access policies (passwords, biometric authentication)
- Establish safe export and storage procedures for exported data
- Maintain physical security of devices

**GDPR implications:**

Using Interviewer in a GDPR-compliant manner requires:
- Securing the device where data is stored
- Regulating who can access the device
- Managing exported files securely
- Maintaining data retention and deletion policies
- Ensuring devices are not lost or stolen

The software itself neither sends nor shares participant data, but you must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it.

## Fresco (Self-hosted web application)

Fresco is a web-based platform deployed entirely by researchers. The software does not send participant data to any external party beyond your own infrastructure.

### Deployment and hosting

**Fresco can be deployed to:**
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Researcher-managed Docker infrastructure
- Any platform that supports Next.js applications

**In every case:**
- All participant data remains under your control
- The developers cannot access any data
- Your chosen hosting provider must meet GDPR requirements
- You are responsible for selecting appropriate data residency options

### Postgres storage (interview data)

Fresco stores interview responses and study configuration in a **Postgres** database.

#### Default deployment: Neon

The recommended hosting provider (Neon) offers:

**Security features:**
- Encryption at rest for all data
- Encryption in transit (TLS connections)
- Automatic backups with point-in-time recovery
- Role-based access control

**GDPR compliance features:**
- EU hosting regions available
- Data residency guarantees
- Compliance with EU data protection regulations
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) available

**Configuration requirements:**
- Select an EU region when creating your database
- Configure access restrictions appropriately
- Implement retention policies according to your study requirements

#### Self-hosted Postgres

For Docker deployments, you must configure:

**Encryption:**
- Disk encryption for the database volume
- TLS for all database connections
- Encryption at rest if required by your institution

**Access control:**
- Secure authentication mechanisms
- Network restrictions (firewall rules)
- Regular security updates

**Backups:**
- Automated backup procedures
- Secure backup storage
- Tested recovery procedures

### S3-compatible storage (study assets only)

<TipBox danger>

Fresco does **not** store binary data collected from participants during interviews. However, it does store **researcher-supplied assets** that may contain personal data.

</TipBox>

**What Fresco stores in S3:**
- Study introduction videos and images
- Protocol logos and branding
- Explanatory materials
- **Roster files (CSV/JSON)** - which may contain participant personally identifiable information (PII) depending on your study design

#### UploadThing

Fresco uses **UploadThing**, which stores files in **Amazon S3**.

**Important limitations:**
- You cannot choose a different storage provider
- Fresco requires UploadThing for asset management

**GDPR compliance options:**

**Free plan:**
- Uses US-based S3 storage by default
- May not be suitable for GDPR-sensitive data

**Paid plans:**
- Allow selection of S3 storage region
- **EU regions available** for GDPR-compliant storage
- Region selection ensures data residency in the EU

**Security features:**
- All S3 assets are automatically **encrypted at rest**
- Fresco enforces server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
- Access is controlled through signed URLs
- Files are not publicly accessible

**GDPR implications:**

If your roster data contains PII, you must:
- Use a paid UploadThing plan
- Select an EU region (or other GDPR-aligned region)
- Ensure your institutional policies allow S3 storage
- Document this in your data protection impact assessment
- Include UploadThing in your data processing records

### Telemetry, analytics, and update checks

**Optional anonymous analytics:**
- Fresco includes optional usage and error analytics
- These analytics contain **no participant data**
- Analytics collect only: feature usage, error types, performance metrics
- You can disable analytics in Fresco settings
- Analytics can also be blocked at the network or firewall level

**Update checks:**
- Triggered only when viewing the Settings screen
- Queries the GitHub API for version information
- **No identifiable information is transmitted**

### Logging and tracking

**Fresco does not:**
- Log IP addresses of participants
- Log request metadata that could identify participants
- Use cookies beyond essential session handling
- Include third-party frontend scripts or tracking pixels
- Share data with advertising or analytics platforms

**Session cookies:**
- Used only for researcher authentication to the dashboard
- Not used for participant tracking
- Encrypted and HTTP-only for security

### Data sensitivity

Although Fresco stores no participant photos or files uploaded during interviews, **interview data itself is highly likely to constitute personal data under GDPR**.

**Types of data collected:**
- Participant responses to survey questions
- Network data (relationships between people)
- Potentially sensitive information about participants and their social networks
- Metadata (interview start/end times, session identifiers)

**GDPR classification:**
- This data should be treated as personal data
- May include special categories of personal data depending on your study
- Requires appropriate legal basis for processing
- Must be protected with technical and organizational measures
