<h2 className="text-lg">"Invalid API Key" error during Vercel deployment</h2>

You may encounter an error in your deployment such as "Invalid API Key", or "API keys must start with...".

</summary>

This error means that you provided an incorrect environment variable. Make sure to enter the environment variable value correctly. You must enter the value that starts after `=` symbol
(e.g: `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=5q5ybg9dwg`, here `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` is the key of variable and `5q5ybg9dwg` is the value. You should always enter the value.)

<h2 className="text-lg">"Instance Expired" message during the setup process</h2>

You may be redirected to a page that informs you that your instance has expired.

</summary>

When completing the initial setup for Fresco, you have 30 minutes to complete the process. If you exceed this time, you will be redirected to a page that informs you that your instance has expired. If this happens, you must delete your database and create a new one.

To delete your database:

1. Navigate to your database on the dashboard by selecting _Storage_ and then selecting your database.

<h2 className="text-lg">Protected URL issue</h2>

You may encounter an issue where your Fresco URL is protected and prompts login through Vercel.

</summary>

This error means that you are using the deployment specific URL, which requires login through Vercel to access. To resolve this issue, use the domain URL provided by Vercel. To find the correct URL:

1. Navigate to your project dashboard. This will be in the format `https://vercel.com/<username>/<project-name>`.

2. Select the _Project_ tab.

3. Click _Visit_ or the URL in the _Domains_ section. Do not use the URL in the _Deployment_ section as it is protected.
