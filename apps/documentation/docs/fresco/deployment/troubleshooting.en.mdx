<h2 className="text-lg">"Invalid environment variables" error during Netlify deployment</h2>

You may encounter an error in your deployment such as "Invalid environment variables"

<h2 className="text-lg">"Instance Expired" message during the setup process</h2>

You may be redirected to a page that informs you that your instance has expired.

</summary>

When completing the initial setup for Fresco, you have 2 hours to complete the process. If you exceed this time, you will be redirected to a page that informs you that your instance has expired. If this happens, you must delete your database and create a new one.

To delete your database:

1. Navigate to your [Neon dashboard](https://console.neon.tech/) and select your project.

<h2 className="text-lg">Protected URL issue</h2>

You may encounter an issue where your Fresco URL is protected and prompts login through Netlify.

</summary>

This error means that you are using the deployment specific URL, which requires login through Netlify to access. To resolve this issue, use the domain URL provided by Netlify. To find the correct URL:

1. Navigate to your project dashboard. This will be in the format `https://app.netlify.com/projects/<project-name>`.

2. Click the URL listed in green below your project name.
