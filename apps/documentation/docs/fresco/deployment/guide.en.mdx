This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your instance of Fresco, including forking the repository, setting up database infrastructure, and deploying to the web.

</SummarySection>

<PrerequisitesSection>
Before you get started, you should:

- Read the [about Fresco](/en/fresco/about) article to understand what Fresco is and how it works.
- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you do not already have one.
- Set aside enough time to complete the deployment process in one sitting. The process could take up to an hour, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the technology or the process.

</PrerequisitesSection>
</SummaryCard>

Thank you for taking the time to deploy Fresco! We hope you find it a valuable tool for your research and data collection. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your instance of Fresco, including forking the repository, setting up database infrastructure, and deploying to the web.

<TipBox danger>

Fresco is in beta and is not yet recommended for use in critical research studies. We encourage users to test Fresco in non-critical environments, and are actively seeking feedback from users to help us improve it.

</TipBox>

## How much does deploying Fresco cost?

Deploying Fresco for your study can be achieved entirely for free using the steps detailed in this guide. We built it this way to allow the broadest possible access to the software. The free deployment method does come with some limitations, such as the amount of data you can store and transfer, and the overall performance of the application.

If you are running a large study, or prefer the peace of mind associated with guaranteed levels of performance, you may wish to use a paid-for cloud provider/database service if your project requires additional features, performance, or capacity. Consult the [cloud pricing](./cloud-pricing) page for more information. Please note that the Network Canvas team does not benefit financially in any way from your choice of cloud provider.

It is also possible to use whatever infrastructure you may have access to in order to deploy Fresco. For information on this, see our [advanced deployment](./advanced) guide.

## Required services

Fresco is different from other software that you may have installed previously. It is a "self-hosted" web
application, meaning that you do not install it on a laptop or desktop. Instead, you "deploy" it to
one or more servers on the Internet (your "infrastructure"), which you can then access from your web browser.

This approach allows researchers to manage their own data and customize the nature of their infrastructure to suit their needs.

<Tipbox danger>

This _also_ means that you are responsible for the security and maintenance of your own deployment! The Network Canvas project team by design has no access to your data or infrastructure.

</Tipbox>

To deploy Fresco, we use the following services and technologies:

- **GitHub**: A platform for hosting and sharing code. The Fresco code is shared via GitHub, and you will need a GitHub account to deploy it.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Fresco uses Node.js to run the server that hosts the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system. Fresco uses PostgreSQL to store data about your study, participants, and responses.
- **UploadThing**: A cloud-based file storage service that Fresco uses to store media files, such as images and audio recordings.

To make the deployment process as simple as possible, we designed Fresco to be easily deployed on
the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) platform, which provides both the Node.js and the PostgreSQL
services for you (for free).

Vercel is a cloud platform that specializes in deploying web
applications. It is designed to be easy to use and has a generous free tier that is suitable for
most research projects. It is not a requirement to use Vercel, but it is the simplest way to get
started, and is the method we will be using in this guide.

## Initial Deployment to Vercel

Deploying Fresco to Vercel involves setting up your own unique version of the project, which we
refer to as your **instance**. This instance will be hosted on Vercel's servers and will be
accessible via a unique URL. You will be able to access your instance of Fresco from any web browser
by visiting this URL.

<Tipbox>

Should you run into any issues, please consult the [troubleshooting](/en/fresco/deployment/troubleshooting) guide or reach out on the [user community](https://community.networkcanvas.com).

</Tipbox>

Before continuing, ensure you have created a GitHub account and are signed in. To create a GitHub account, visit [github.com](https://github.com/signup).

### Step 1: Create an app on UploadThing

Fresco uses a third-party service called _UploadThing_ to store media files, including protocol assets.
The first step in deploying Fresco is to create an account with UploadThing that will allow us to generate an API key
that Fresco will use to communicate with the service.

<Tipbox>

Your UploadThing account is unique to you, meaning that no one else will have access to the files you upload within Fresco.

</Tipbox>

To create an app on UploadThing:

1. Go to <a href="https://uploadthing.com" target="_blank">uploadthing.com</a>.

2. Click **"Get started"**.

   ![Select "Get Started"](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing1.png)

3. Sign in with Github.

   ![Sign In with GitHub](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing2.png)

4. Authorize UploadThing by clicking **"Authorize pingdotgg"**.

   ![Authorize pingdotgg](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing3.png)

5. You will be prompted to navigate to your dashboard. From the dashboard Click **"Create a new app"**.

   ![Create a new app](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing4.png)

6. Give your app a name and click **"Create App"**.

   ![Create app](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing5.png)

7. From your dashboard, navigate to the **"API Keys"** section from the sidebar and copy your API keys.

   <TipBox>

   Save your API keys in a safe place as you complete this guide! We will be using them at the end to deploy Fresco on Vercel. We suggest pasting them into a text file or notes app.

   </TipBox>

   ![Copy your API keys](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing6.png)

For more information about UploadThing, please review the <a href="https://docs.uploadthing.com" target="_blank">UploadThing Docs</a>.

### Step 2: Fork Fresco Repository

The next step requires us to create a copy (or "fork") of the Fresco code. This will allow us to deploy our own unique instance of Fresco.

To create a fork of the Fresco repository:

1. Visit the [Fresco repository on GitHub](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco), and click **"Fork"**.

   ![](/assets/img/fresco-images/github-fork1.png)

2. Create your Fork

   Enter a repository name (this will be your Fresco instance name, so you may wish to use your study name or the name of your project), description (optional), and click **"Create Fork"**.
   ![](/assets/img/fresco-images/github-fork2.png)

Once you have completed this step, you will be redirected to your forked repository on GitHub. This copy of the Fresco code is now yours to deploy as you wish.

### Step 3: Deploy your fork to Vercel

Next, we will deploy your fork to the Vercel platform. You can use the "hobby" tier (which is free) or paid plan (for more information about cloud pricing, read our [cloud pricing](./cloud-pricing) documentation), but for the purposes of this guide, we will use the free tier.

1. Click <a href="https://vercel.com/new" target="_blank">
   here

   </a> to create a new project on Vercel.

   <Tipbox>

   Sign in to Vercel via your Github account so that you can easily connect to your forked repository.

   </Tipbox>

2. Import Git Repository

   Find your Fresco instance from the list of your git repositories and click **"Import"**.
   ![Import Git Repository](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel2.png)

3. Configure Environment Variables

   ![Configure Environment Variables and Deploy](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-configure.png)

   Copy the template below and paste it into the Environment Variables section in Vercel to pre-populate the form with the required environment variables.

   Replace the values with your environment variable values from UploadThing you copied in [Step 1](#step-1-create-an-app-on-uploadthing)

   ```bash
   UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your_uploadthing_api_key
   UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your_uploadthing_app_id
   ```

   <TipBox>

   We use anonymous analytics to gather error data from instances of Fresco to troubleshoot issues. No identifiable information of any kind is collected or sent to us.

   If you would like to disable all analytics, add an additional environment variable to your Vercel deployment called `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` and set it to `true`. For example:

   ```bash
   DISABLE_ANALYTICS=true
   ```

   By leaving `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` set to `false` (the default) you will help us identify bugs and improve the app.

   </TipBox>

   <TipBox danger>

   When entering the environment variables, do **not** include the variable key (e.g: `UPLOADTHING_SECRET=`). You should enter the value of the variable _value_, which starts after the equals (`=`) symbol (e.g: `sk_live_xxxx`)

   Additionally, when providing the environment variables do **not** enclose the variable values in quotes. For example:

   ✅ Correct:
   `sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

   ❌ Incorrect:
   `'sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'`

   </TipBox>

4. Deploy

   Click **"Deploy"** and wait for the deployment to finish.

   <TipBox>

   The first deployment will fail because the database has not been set up yet. We will set up the database in the next step.

   </TipBox>

5. Go to Project

   After the initial deployment fails, select **"Go to Project"** to view your project dashboard.

   ![Initial Deployment Failed. Click Go to Project.](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel5.png)

### Step 4: Create your database

1. From your project dashboard, select **"Storage"**. Then, select **Create** within the Postgres row.
   ![Storage](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel6.png)
   ![Create a Postgres database](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-1.png)

2. Review and accept the terms in the modal.
   ![Accept terms](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-2.png)

3. Give your database a name and select the region that is closest to where you and your participants will be located. Then, click **"Create"**. Your database will be generated and you will be redirected to the Getting Started page.

   ![Enter a name and create the database](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-3.png)

4. You will be prompted to connect your project. Select **"Connect"**.

   ![Connect database to your project](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-4.png)

5. Select the **"Deployments"** tab. Click on the menu beside the most recent deployment and select **"Redeploy"**. This will redeploy your project with your new connected database.

   ![Redeploy app](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-5.png)

</TipBox>

### Step 5: Visit your deployed app

Visit your deployed Fresco app by clicking on the preview or go to your dashboard by clicking **"Continue to Dashboard"**.

![Continue to dashboard](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel3.png)

Then, click on one of the domain names or the **"Visit"** button.

![Visit domain](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel4.png)

### Step 6 (Optional): Set up a custom domain

If you prefer to use a custom domain for your Fresco instance, you can configure this in the Vercel dashboard by following these steps:

1. Navigate to your project dashboard. Here, locate and click on the **"Domains"** button.

   ![Navigate to domains section](/assets/img/fresco-images/set-domain1.png)

2. In the Domains section, you have two options:

   - If you have a purchased domain, you can add it here.
   - Alternatively, you can modify the default Vercel domain to suit your needs.

   ![Domain setup options](/assets/img/fresco-images/set-domain2.png)

   <TipBox danger>

   While editing the current domain, make sure not to remove the **.vercel.app** portion. Vercel requires this standard for all free domains.

   </TipBox>

## Configuration and Setup

To use Fresco, you need to set up an administrator account which will enable you to access the protected parts of the app for study management. Only one administrator account can be created.

<TipBox danger>

To ensure the security of your deployment, you have **30 minutes** from when the app is deployed to create a user account. If this time elapses without a user account being created, your configuration will expire. To redeploy, follow our guide to [reset your database](/en/fresco/deployment/troubleshooting#instance-expired-message-during-the-setup-process).

</TipBox>

### Create an account

Visit your deployed app and enter a username and password.

![Enter a username and password](/assets/img/fresco-images/fresco1.png)

<TipBox>

Only **one** user account can be created in Fresco. If you need access for multiple team members, we recommend using a shared username and password for the administrator account to ensure that your team can access the platform.

</TipBox>

<TipBox danger>

If you forget your password, you **will not be able to reset it**. We recommend keeping a record of your username and password in a secure location.

</TipBox>

### Upload a protocol

You can optionally upload a protocol. Protocols can also be uploaded from the protocols page once the setup steps are completed.

![Upload a protocol](/assets/img/fresco-images/fresco2.png)

### Configure participation

- **Import participants**: You can optionally upload a CSV file containing participants you wish to recruit to your study. Participants can also be uploaded from the participants page once the setup steps are completed.

- **Allow anonymous recruitment**: You can enable this setting to allow your participants to join your study by visiting a URL. More information about anonymous recruitment can be found in the [using Fresco](/en/fresco/using-fresco) guide.
  ![Import participants and optionally, allow anonymous recruitment](/assets/img/fresco-images/fresco3.png)
