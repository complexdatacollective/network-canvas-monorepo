<SummaryCard duration="60 minutes">

<SummarySection>

For most users, the default [deployment process](./guide) will be sufficient. However, if your circumstances require using different cloud infrastructure or a VPS, you can do so by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

</SummarySection>

<PrerequisitesSection>

This guide is intended for advanced, technical users who are already familiar with Docker and cloud infrastructure. It provides a high-level overview of the steps required to deploy Fresco using Docker, but does not provide detailed instructions for each step.

If you are not already familiar with these technologies, we recommend following our [default deployment guide](./guide).

</PrerequisitesSection>
</SummaryCard>

<Tipbox danger>
  Because of the nature of self-hosting Dockerized applications on cloud
  infrastructure, you are responsible for the security and maintenance of your
  own deployment! The Network Canvas project team by design has no access to
  your data or infrastructure.
</Tipbox>

For an advanced deployment of Fresco, you will need to find a cloud service or a Linux-based VPS provider that supports Docker.

Possible hosting services:

- [Digial Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Your own VPS

## Pulling the Fresco image from the container registry

Pull the Docker image directly from our [container registry](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco/pkgs/container/fresco). We provide two types of tags for our images:

- `latest`: This tag always corresponds to the most recent version of Fresco. Use this if you want to stay up-to-date with the latest features and fixes.
- `vX.Y.Z`: These tags follow semantic versioning. Use this if you need a specific version of Fresco for your project.

To pull the Fresco image from the container registry, use the following command:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/complexdatacollective/fresco:latest
```

## Configure Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file. You can use the simplified template below. The next steps will guide you through setting up the environment variables and adding them to this file.

```bash
# -------------------
# Optional environment variables
# -------------------

#DISABLE_ANALYTICS=
#INSTALLATION_ID=
#SANDBOX_MODE=

# -------------------
# Required environment variables
# -------------------

UPLOADTHING_SECRET=
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=

POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DATABASE=
POSTGRES_HOST=
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=
PUBLIC_URL=

```

### Optional Variables

| **Variable**          | **Details**                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **DISABLE_ANALYTICS** | If true, the app will not send anonymous analytics data to the server. Defaults to false.                                |
| **INSTALLATION_ID**   | A unique identifier for your application, used primarily for analytics. If not set, it's generated automatically.        |
| **SANDBOX_MODE**      | If true, the app will use the sandbox mode, which disables resetting the database and other features. Defaults to false. |

<TipBox>

We use anonymous analytics to gather error data from instances of Fresco to troubleshoot issues. No identifiable information of any kind is collected or sent to us.

If you would like to disable all analytics, set `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` to `true`.

By leaving `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` set to `false` (the default) you will help us identify bugs and improve the app.

   </TipBox>
   
### Required Variables

The following steps will guide you through configuring the required environment variables.

### Create a storage bucket using UploadThing

Fresco uses a third-party service called 'UploadThing' to store media files, including protocol assets. In order to use this service, you need to create an account with UploadThing that will allow you to generate an API key that Fresco can use to securely communicate with it.

<Tipbox>

Your UploadThing account is unique to you, meaning that no one else will have access to the files stored in your instance of Fresco. For more information about UploadThing, please review the <a href="https://docs.uploadthing.com" target="_blank">UploadThing Docs</a>.

</Tipbox>

To create an app on UploadThing:

1. Go to <a href="https://uploadthing.com" target="_blank">uploadthing.com</a>.

2. Click **"Get started"**.

   ![Select "Get Started"](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing1.png)

3. Sign in with Github.

4. Authorize UploadThing by clicking **"Authorize pingdotgg"**.

5. You will be prompted to navigate to your dashboard. From the dashboard Click **"Create a new app"**.

   ![Create a new app](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing4.png)

6. Give your app a name and click **"Create App"**. Do not change the region.

   ![Create app](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing5.png)

7. From your dashboard, navigate to the **"API Keys"** section from the sidebar and copy your API keys using the copy button.

   ![Copy your API keys](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing6.png)

8. Pate your API keys into the `.env` file you created in the previous step.

| **Variable**           | **Details**                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **UPLOADTHING_SECRET** | Your UploadThing secret key |
| **UPLOADTHING_APP_ID** | Your UploadThing app ID     |

### Postgres Environment Variables Configuration

Fresco uses a PostgreSQL database to store data. For advanced deployment, you will need to set up a PostgreSQL database on your server.

You will need to set the following environment variables to configure your Postgres database and connect it to Fresco:

| **Variable**                 | **Details**                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **POSTGRES_USER**            | Your PostgreSQL username                 |
| **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**        | Your PostgreSQL password                 |
| **POSTGRES_DATABASE**        | Your PostgreSQL database name            |
| **POSTGRES_HOST**            | Your PostgreSQL host                     |
| **POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL**      | A pooled connection URL for Prisma.      |
| **POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING** | A non-pooling connection URL for Prisma. |

Set these variables in your `.env` file. If you are using Docker Compose, these variables will be injected into the Postgres container and the Fresco container by specifying the `.env` file path.

## Container Orchestration with Docker Compose

We recommend that you use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to manage the Postgres container in tandem with the Fresco container. For your convenience, we have provided a [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco/blob/main/docker-compose.prod.yml) file at the root of the Fresco repository.

```yaml
services:
  fresco:
    env_file:
      - .env
    image: 'ghcr.io/complexdatacollective/fresco:feature-docker'
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    volumes:
      - .:/app/next-app
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 0:3000
    networks:
      - fresco_network

  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'pg_isready', '-U', 'postgres']
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
    networks:
      - fresco_network

volumes:
  postgres:

# Define a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
networks:
  fresco_network:
```

### Build and Run Fresco with Docker Compose

Start up your application by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Access Fresco

You can now access Fresco by visiting the `PUBLIC_URL` that you have configured in your hosting service.

To learn how to configure Fresco, please refer to the [configuration and setup guide](./guide#configuration-and-setup).
