We have created a [Sandbox Fresco deployment](https://fresco-sandbox.networkcanvas.com) as a way to explore the Fresco platform without setting up your own instance.

**The sandbox deployment is a shared example environment not intended for real interviews.**

There are no restrictions on the use of the sandbox, but we will periodically reset the database. This means that any data you upload will be deleted.

<TipBox danger>

Any protocol files uploaded will be visible to all users of the sandbox. Please be mindful of the data you upload.

**Under no circumstances should real study or participant data be uploaded.**

</TipBox>

To access the sandbox, visit [https://fresco-sandbox.networkcanvas.com](https://fresco-sandbox.networkcanvas.com) and use the following credentials:
