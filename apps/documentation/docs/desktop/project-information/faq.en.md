This page contains answers to frequently asked questions specific to the desktop applications (Architect and Interviewer). For general questions about the Network Canvas project, please see the [Project FAQ](/en/project/project-information/faq).

## Which hardware do I need to run the different components of the Network Canvas suite?

The Network Canvas suite consists of three applications, with each component running on a variety of platforms:

- Architect is a desktop app, and will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
- Interviewer is a hybrid desktop/mobile app, and will run on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. It will work best with a touch screen device, but will also function well with a conventional computer that uses a keyboard and mouse. Specific functionality may vary by operating system.
- Fresco is a web-based application. For information on supported browsers, devices, and platforms, see our [Fresco FAQ](/en/fresco/faq#which-browsers-are-supported).

Our development test devices have included a Samsung Chromebook Plus, iPad Pros (both 9.7" and 12.1"), and the Google Pixel C tablet. We have also completed Network Canvas studies using 27 inch "all in one" touchscreen computers with positive results.

Although Network Canvas has not been tested on all possible hardware configurations, we anticipate that most mid to high-end laptop computers and tablets will be capable of running the software well. Please see our article on [choosing hardware for a study](/en/desktop/getting-started/choosing-hardware) for more information. If you are planning data collection and have specific questions, please create a post on our [user community](https://community.networkcanvas.com).

## My research involves sensitive data. What security features does the Network Canvas suite have to keep my data secure?

Our software was conceived in the context of research of a highly sensitive nature, so we understand that for many researchers security is of the utmost importance.

We do not transmit, collect or retain any data from or about your study. The data you collect in the field is yours, and is only ever stored on your devices. This provides a baseline level of security, but also means that a large part of the responsibility for securing devices and data falls on the researcher. Please review our articles on [configuring devices prior to starting data collection](../getting-started/configuring-devices), and [IRB and security best practices](/en/project/project-information/irb-best-practices) to ensure that you are aware of the most common weaknesses. You should also consult with your institutional IT or security experts.

If you are working in a scenario where you have access to a network connection with internet access, you can use an [online workflow](/en/desktop/tutorials/protocol-and-data-workflows#option-1-online-workflow) or you can implement an entirely [offline workflow](../tutorials/protocol-and-data-workflows#option-2-offline-workflow) that does not require data to be transmitted. Further details of the security model we implement can be [found here](./security-model).

If you have specific security requirements, please contact us to discuss how we can make our software suite compliant with your needs.
