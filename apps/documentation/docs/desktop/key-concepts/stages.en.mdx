<Definition>
Stages are the individual steps in a Network Canvas interview. Each stage is a configured instance of an Interface that collects specific data or presents information to participants.
</Definition>

## Overview

When you design a protocol in Architect, you create a sequence of stages that participants progress through during the interview. Each stage serves a specific purpose—collecting names, gathering attributes, showing information, or creating network relationships.

Stages are the building blocks of your interview protocol. By combining different types of stages in a thoughtful sequence, you create an interview that is engaging for participants while collecting the network data you need.

## Stages vs. Interfaces

Understanding the relationship between stages and Interfaces is essential:

**[Interfaces](/en/desktop/key-concepts/interfaces):** Templates or types of data collection tools
- Generic and reusable
- Define what kind of data can be collected
- Examples: Name Generator, Ego Form, Sociogram

**Stages:** Configured instances of Interfaces in your protocol
- Specific to your protocol
- Configured with your questions, variables, and settings
- Each stage has a name and appears in a specific order

**Analogy:** If an Interface is like a form template (blank), a stage is like a filled-out form configured for a specific purpose.

### Example

**Interface:** Name Generator (using forms)

**Stages you might create:**
1. Stage 1: "Name close friends" - A Name Generator stage configured to ask "Who are your close friends?"
2. Stage 2: "Name family members" - Another Name Generator stage configured to ask "Who are your family members?"

Both stages use the same Interface (Name Generator), but each is configured differently with unique questions, prompts, and settings.

## The stage timeline

In Architect, stages appear in a timeline view that shows:
- The order stages appear in the interview
- The name of each stage
- The Interface type used
- Whether stages have [skip logic](/en/desktop/key-concepts/skip-logic) enabled

![The Architect timeline showing multiple stages](/assets/img/key-concepts/stages/timeline.png)

Participants experience stages in order from left to right (or top to bottom), though [skip logic](/en/desktop/key-concepts/skip-logic) can conditionally skip stages based on interview data.

## Creating stages

### Adding a stage

To add a stage to your protocol in Architect:

1. Click the **Add new stage** button in the timeline
2. Select an Interface type from the list
3. Configure the stage settings
4. Give the stage a descriptive name
5. Save your stage

### Stage configuration

Each stage has configuration options that depend on the Interface type:

**Common to all stages:**
- **Stage name:** Descriptive name for your reference (not shown to participants)
- **[Prompts](/en/desktop/key-concepts/prompts):** Questions or instructions shown to participants
- **[Skip logic](/en/desktop/key-concepts/skip-logic):** Conditions for showing or skipping the stage

**Interface-specific settings:**

**Name Generators:**
- Node type to create
- [Forms](/en/desktop/key-concepts/forms) for collecting alter attributes
- Side panels for additional functionality
- [Network filtering](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering) for side panels

**Forms (Ego Form, Per-Alter Form):**
- Form fields and [variables](/en/desktop/key-concepts/variables)
- [Input controls](/en/desktop/key-concepts/input-controls)
- [Validation rules](/en/desktop/key-concepts/field-validation)
- Network filtering (for alter/edge forms)

**Bins (Categorical Bin, Ordinal Bin):**
- Variable to assign
- Bin definitions (categories or order)
- [Network filtering](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering)

**Sociogram:**
- Edge types to collect
- Layout variables
- Background images
- Edge creation rules

**Information Interface:**
- Content to display (text, images, video)
- [Resources](/en/desktop/key-concepts/resources) to include

## Stage ordering

### Reordering stages

You can rearrange stages by dragging and dropping them in the timeline. The order matters because:

1. **Data dependencies:** Later stages can use data collected in earlier stages
2. **Participant experience:** The sequence affects interview flow and comprehension
3. **Skip logic:** Conditions are evaluated based on data collected so far

### Best practices for ordering

**Start with context:**
- Begin with Information stages that explain the interview
- Introduce concepts before asking about them

**Build progressively:**
- Name Generators early (create the network)
- Name Interpreters after (collect attributes about named alters)
- Sociograms after alters are known (create relationships)

**Group related content:**
- Multiple stages about the same topic together
- Use consistent Interface types for similar questions

**Consider burden:**
- Easier tasks early (builds engagement)
- More demanding tasks in the middle (when attention is high)
- Lighter tasks toward the end (prevent fatigue)

**Enable filtering and skip logic:**
- Variables must be set before they can be used
- Set up filtering/sorting variables before stages that need them

### Example stage sequence

```
1. Information: Welcome and instructions
2. Name Generator: "Who are people you know?"
3. Categorical Bin: "How do you know each person?"
4. Per-Alter Form: "Details about family members" (filtered to family)
5. Per-Alter Form: "Details about friends" (filtered to friends)
6. Sociogram: "Who knows each other?"
7. Ordinal Bin: "How close are you to each person?"
8. Information: Thank you and next steps
```

## Stage naming

### Why stage names matter

Stage names help you:
- Understand the protocol structure at a glance
- Find specific stages quickly
- Document your protocol for others
- Remember your design decisions later

### Naming best practices

**Be descriptive:**
- ✅ "Name close friends"
- ✅ "Collect alter demographics"
- ✅ "Show study information"
- ✗ "Stage 1"
- ✗ "Name generator"
- ✗ "Form"

**Use consistent patterns:**
- Start with verb: "Name...", "Collect...", "Show..."
- Include the topic: "...close friends", "...demographics"
- Reference filtering if applicable: "...about family members"

**Keep them concise:**
- Aim for 3-6 words
- Avoid full sentences
- Use abbreviations sparingly (only if clear)

**Examples by Interface type:**

**Name Generators:**
- "Name close friends"
- "Name family members"
- "Select coworkers from roster"

**Forms:**
- "Ego demographics"
- "Alter relationship details"
- "Family member information"

**Bins:**
- "Categorize by relationship type"
- "Rank by closeness"
- "Sort by contact frequency"

**Sociograms:**
- "Show friendships"
- "Map family connections"
- "Identify support network"

**Information:**
- "Welcome screen"
- "Explain network concepts"
- "Thank you message"

## Stage preview

You can preview individual stages or the entire protocol:

**Preview single stage:**
1. Select a stage from the timeline
2. Click **Preview** in the stage editor
3. Interact with the stage as a participant would
4. Make adjustments based on the preview

**Preview protocol:**
1. Click **Preview Protocol** in Architect
2. Experience the entire interview flow
3. Test skip logic and filtering
4. Verify stage order and transitions

**Why preview matters:**
- Catch configuration errors
- Test participant experience
- Verify skip logic works correctly
- Check that [network filtering](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering) displays appropriate content
- Ensure [prompts](/en/desktop/key-concepts/prompts) are clear

## Managing stages

### Editing stages

To edit an existing stage:
1. Click the stage in the timeline
2. Modify settings in the stage editor
3. Save your changes

**Note:** Changes apply immediately to the protocol. If you're using the protocol for data collection, consider versioning to track changes.

### Duplicating stages

To create a similar stage quickly:
1. Select a stage
2. Click the duplicate button
3. Modify the duplicated stage as needed

**Use cases:**
- Creating multiple similar Per-Alter Form stages for different filtered groups
- Setting up parallel stages for different node types
- Reusing complex configurations

### Deleting stages

To remove a stage:
1. Select the stage
2. Click the delete button
3. Confirm deletion

**Warning:** Deleting stages cannot be undone. Consider:
- Will this affect skip logic that references this stage?
- Are variables created here used elsewhere?
- Is data already collected using this stage?

## Special stage types

### Information stages

Information stages don't collect data—they display content to participants:
- Instructions and explanations
- Consent information
- Videos or images
- Thank you messages

**Best practices:**
- Keep content concise
- Use clear language
- Include visuals when helpful
- Don't overload with text

### Ego form stages

Ego Form stages collect data about the participant (ego):
- Demographics
- Attitudes
- Behaviors
- Consent

**Best practices:**
- Collect ego data early (often after introduction)
- Keep ego forms focused (one topic per stage)
- Consider using multiple shorter forms instead of one long form

### Final stages

The last stage in your protocol should:
- Thank participants
- Explain next steps
- Provide contact information
- Indicate the interview is complete

## Stages in the interview

### How participants experience stages

When participants complete an interview in Interviewer:

1. **Start screen:** Select which protocol to use
2. **Enter case ID:** Identify the interview session
3. **First stage loads:** Begin the interview
4. **Progress through stages:** Complete each stage in sequence
5. **Skip logic evaluated:** Some stages may be skipped automatically
6. **Final stage:** Interview concludes
7. **Return to start screen:** Session can be exported

### Stage transitions

Participants move between stages by:
- Clicking **Next** (or similar button) to advance
- Having stages skipped automatically via [skip logic](/en/desktop/key-concepts/skip-logic)
- Navigating backward (if protocol allows)

### Progress indication

Participants can see:
- Current stage name (if configured)
- Progress through the protocol (stage X of Y)
- How many stages remain

## Stages and data collection

### Data scope by stage type

**Name Generator stages:**
- Create nodes (alters)
- Collect initial alter attributes
- Define network members

**Name Interpreter stages:**
- Add attributes to existing nodes
- Create edges between nodes
- Categorize or sort nodes

**Ego Form stages:**
- Collect participant-level data
- One record per interview

**Sociogram stages:**
- Create edges between alters
- Assign edge attributes
- Store layout information

### Data persistence

Data collected in stages persists throughout the interview:
- Alters created in one stage appear in later stages
- Attributes assigned early are available later
- [Skip logic](/en/desktop/key-concepts/skip-logic) can use any previously collected data
- [Network filtering](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering) can filter on any assigned variable

## Advanced stage configuration

### Skip logic

[Skip logic](/en/desktop/key-concepts/skip-logic) allows stages to be conditionally shown or skipped:
- Show stage only if ego is above certain age
- Skip stage if no alters were named
- Display stage only for specific participant types

See the [Skip Logic guide](/en/desktop/key-concepts/skip-logic) for details.

### Network filtering

[Network filtering](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering) controls which nodes or edges appear within a stage:
- Show only family members on a form
- Display only close friends in a bin
- Filter to alters with specific attributes

See the [Network Filtering guide](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering) for details.

### Multiple prompts

Some stages support multiple prompts:
- Present different questions for the same Interface
- Collect different variables using the same stage
- Reduce total stage count while maintaining flexibility

See the [Prompts guide](/en/desktop/key-concepts/prompts) for details.

## Best practices

### Plan before building

1. **Outline interview flow:** Sketch the sequence on paper first
2. **Define data needs:** List what you need to collect
3. **Group related questions:** Combine when appropriate, separate when needed
4. **Consider participant burden:** Balance detail with completion rates

### Design for the participant

1. **Clear progression:** Logical flow from stage to stage
2. **Consistent formatting:** Similar stages look similar
3. **Helpful instructions:** Explain what to do at each stage
4. **Reasonable length:** Aim for 30-45 minute total interview time

### Test thoroughly

1. **Preview individual stages:** Check each stage works correctly
2. **Preview full protocol:** Test entire interview flow
3. **Test skip logic:** Verify conditions work as intended
4. **Pilot with real users:** Get feedback before main data collection

### Document your protocol

1. **Use descriptive stage names:** Future you will thank present you
2. **Comment complex configurations:** Note why you made certain choices
3. **Version your protocol:** Track changes over time
4. **Share with team:** Ensure collaborators understand the structure

## Troubleshooting

### Stage not appearing in interview

**Possible causes:**
- Skip logic is hiding the stage
- Stage is after a stage that ends the interview
- Protocol not saved

**Solutions:**
- Review skip logic conditions
- Check stage order in timeline
- Ensure protocol was saved after changes

### Stage showing empty network

**Possible causes:**
- [Network filtering](/en/desktop/key-concepts/network-filtering) too restrictive
- No alters match filter criteria
- Alters not created on earlier stage

**Solutions:**
- Review filter rules
- Check that filtering variables are set on earlier stages
- Verify alters are being created

### Can't delete stage

**Possible causes:**
- Stage is referenced in skip logic
- Variables created here used elsewhere

**Solutions:**
- Remove skip logic references first
- Remove or reassign variables
- Check all stages for dependencies

### Stage configuration not saving

**Possible causes:**
- Validation errors in configuration
- Required fields missing

**Solutions:**
- Check for error messages
- Verify all required fields completed
- Try saving individual sections first
