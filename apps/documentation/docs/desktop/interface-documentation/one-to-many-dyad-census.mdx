<InterfaceMeta type="Edge Generator" creates="Edges of one or more types" usesprompts="true" />

</InterfaceSummary>

This interface is a variation of the Dyad Census that allows participants to create edges between one alter and multiple other alters. It is particularly useful for collecting edges where one alter has relationships with many others, such as a central figure in a network.

The interfaces allows for configuring whether or not the "focal node" returns to the main node list after it has been considered, or if it is removed from the list (the default).


### Best Practices

<GoodPractice>

Use this interface to encourage participants to add edges that they might not have considered, especially when one alter has relationships with multiple others.

</GoodPractice>

<GoodPractice>

Use this interface in favour of the standard Dyad Census when you expect that one alter will have many relationships with others, as it simplifies the process for participants.

</GoodPractice>

### Try to Avoid

<BadPractice>

Using this interface with a large number of alters will result in a large number of screens (exponentially increasing as the number of alters increases). If you have many alters, consider using other methods to collect edges, such as the [Sociogram](/en/desktop/interface-documentation/sociogram).
