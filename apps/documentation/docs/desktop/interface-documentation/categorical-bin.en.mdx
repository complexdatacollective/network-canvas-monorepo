</InterfaceSummary>

The Categorical Bin is a name interpreter Interface that collects nominal data on the alters in a participant's network. When using the Categorical Bin, participants drag and drop alters one-by-one into colorful circles which each represent a category of the categorical variable. Once placed, participants can tap on any category and move alters within that category to any other.

## Configuring Categorical Bin

A Categorical Bin screen can include multiple [prompts](../key-concepts/prompts), each of which relates to a single categorical variable.

Additionally an _other_ variable can be specified for custom responses that don't fit into the pre-configured categories.

### Best Practices

<GoodPractice>

Use this Interface to collect nominal data on alters. Although a Toggle Button
Group can be added as an [input control](../key-concepts/input-controls) on
other interfaces, the drag and drop functionality on the Categorical Bin
provides a tactile method to capturing these data that is engaging for
participants.

</GoodPractice>

### Try to Avoid

<BadPractice>

Avoid using more than eight categories on this Interface. More categories
cause the category labels to be difficult to read and the other visual
compromises on the Interface become compromised.

</BadPractice>

<BadPractice>

Avoid using the Categorical Bin to capture dichotomous variables. Dichotomous
variables are best captured using the Toggle [input
control](../key-concepts/input-controls) (on a [Name
Generator](../interface-documentation/name-generator-using-forms) or [Per
Alter Form](../interface-documentation/per-alter-form)) or using the variable
toggling feature on the [Sociogram](../interface-documentation/sociogram).
