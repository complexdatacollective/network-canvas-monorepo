# Welcome to Network Canvas

Network Canvas is a suite of tools for conducting social network research. This section contains documentation that applies to all Network Canvas applications.

## The Network Canvas Suite

The Network Canvas ecosystem consists of three main applications:

- **[Architect](/en/project/tutorials/building-a-protocol)** - A desktop application for designing interview protocols
- **[Interviewer](/en/desktop)** - Desktop and mobile applications for conducting interviews in the field
- **[Fresco](/en/fresco)** - A web-based platform for deploying interviews online

## Getting Started

Whether you're using the desktop applications (Architect and Interviewer) or the web-based Fresco platform, you'll work with the same core concepts:

- **[Protocol Files](/en/project/key-concepts/the-protocol-file)** - The foundation of all Network Canvas interviews
- **[Variables](/en/project/key-concepts/variables)** - Data fields you define to collect information
- **[Interfaces](/en/project/key-concepts/interfaces)** - The building blocks of your interview stages
- **[Forms](/en/project/key-concepts/forms)** - Collect detailed data from participants

## Key Sections

### [Key Concepts](/en/project/key-concepts)
