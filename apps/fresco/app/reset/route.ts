 *
 * For example, if a database is wiped outside of the app, app settings won't
 * be refetched automatically because they are aggressively cached. This can
 * cause issues such as being redirected to the login screen, even though the
 * app is unconfigured and there are no users.
 *
 * Visiting this route handler should clear all caches and redirect the user
 * to the root of the app.
