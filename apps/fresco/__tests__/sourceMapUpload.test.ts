/**
 * PostHog resolves a minified stack frame by matching the chunk ID baked into
 * the bundle against an uploaded source map, so a map is only useful when it
 * came from the build that produced the deployed bundle. For Fresco that build
 * is the Dockerfile's, in the mirror repository — nothing in this repository
 * builds the bundle the image serves. These assertions keep that upload path
 * wired: without them it can be "simplified" away and every Fresco exception
 * silently goes back to unresolved frames, which is what the PostHog triage
 * that prompted this found (`No sourcemap uploaded for chunk id: …`).
