# @codaco/network-query

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c058462: The screen that ends an interview is now part of the protocol. Researchers can
  write what participants read before and after they finish, translate it like
  the rest of the protocol, and choose how an interview that ends there is
  recorded: completed, ineligible, or ended early. That outcome is saved with each
  interview and exported. A finish stage either waits for participants to confirm
  or finishes the interview as soon as they reach it, and a protocol can end with
  several, such as a separate ending for participants who are not eligible.

  **Protocols (`@codaco/protocol-validation`)**

  - Schema 9 adds the `FinishSession` stage type, with a stage name, a `mode`
    of `confirmation` or `automatic`, the closing screen's Markdown (`content`,
    heading included, shown only in `confirmation` mode), the finished screen's
    Markdown (`finishedContent`), the Finish button label, confirmation question
    and failure message, and an `outcome` of `completed`, `ineligible` or
    `terminated`. It has no skip logic.
  - Every schema 9 protocol must end with a finish stage, and may end with
    several. Validation refuses a protocol with no stages, one whose last stage
    is not a finish stage, and any other stage after the first finish stage.
    `findTimelineStructureProblems` reports the same problems for a list of
    stages without validating the stages themselves.
  - The v8 to v9 migration appends a finish stage in `confirmation` mode, with
    id `finish` (or the next free `finish-2`, `finish-3`, …), outcome
    `completed`, and the text the interview has always shown there, in English under the protocol's default
    language. Its notes say so. A recorded interview that was on the old
    finish screen resumes on the new finish stage. Run again over a document
    already in schema 9 form, it keeps a finish stage the document already ends
    at, and gives one that has none the supplied text in the document's own
    languages.
  - A finish stage's name and text may have no translation at all while a
    protocol is being written, so a protocol in a language Network Canvas has no
    closing text for starts without any. `validateProtocol` still refuses a
    protocol whose finish stage has no finished text, or no closing text in
    `confirmation` mode, in its default language, with the issue code `finish_stage_text_missing`
    (`FINISH_STAGE_TEXT_MISSING`) naming what is missing. An editor passes
    `{ draft: true }` to allow it while the protocol is written.
    `findFinishStageTextProblems` reports the same problem without validating.
    Text made only of spaces or invisible characters counts as missing, and a
    translation of a finish stage's name or text that is given at all
    must not be blank, in any language and in a draft too.
  - `createDefaultFinishSessionStage`, `defaultFinishSessionText`,
    `defaultFinishSessionFields`, `hasDefaultFinishSessionText` and
    `withDefaultFinishSessionTranslation` supply that text in English, German,
    Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, and
    Simplified and Traditional Chinese.

  **Interview runtime (`@codaco/interview`)**

  - In `confirmation` mode the finish stage shows its closing text and a Finish
    button, which asks participants to confirm; once the interview is finished
    it shows the finished text. If finishing fails, the closing text comes back
    with an error toast. Participants can go back until they finish.
  - In `automatic` mode the interview finishes as soon as the stage is shown,
    and participants then see the finished text. They can't go back. If
    finishing fails they see the error with a button to try again.
  - No finish stage lets participants move forward. Finishing records which
    finish stage the interview ended at and its outcome.
  - **Breaking:** `onFinish` is now called as
    `onFinish(interviewId, { stageId, outcome }, signal)`. Hosts store both
    values and pass `finishStageId` back in `SessionPayload` when they reopen the
    interview.
  - A finished interview opens in its completed state: the finished text of
    the finish stage it ended at, with no way back into the interview. A host can add its own actions to it with
    the new `completedActions` prop. Review mode stops before the finish stage,
    and the stages menu no longer lists finish stages. A review of a protocol
    with nothing before its finish stage shows that stage's text read-only,
    with an **Exit review** button when the host passes `onExit`.
  - A host that lets a finished interview be changed passes the new
    `openFinishedAsActive` Shell prop. The interview then opens at its stages
    rather than in its completed state.
  - A finish stage with no text, which only an Architect preview of a protocol
    still being written can have, shows the Finish button alone.
  - `generateNetwork` leaves a completed synthetic interview on the finish
    stage its route reached, rather than one step past the last stage, and
    Fresco and Interviewer record that stage and its outcome.
  - Progress is 100% on every finish stage, not only the last one.
  - Skip logic that skips to the finish goes to the first finish stage after the
    stage that owns the rule. Skip logic can also name a later finish stage.

  **Exports (`@codaco/network-exporters`, `@codaco/shared-consts`)**

  - Each interview's outcome is exported: CSV ego files have a
    `networkCanvasFinishOutcome` column after `COMMIT_HASH`, and
    GraphML graphs an `nc:finishOutcome` attribute. **Breaking:**
    `InterviewExportInput` requires `finishOutcome`; pass `null` for an interview with no recorded
    outcome, whose CSV cell is then empty and whose GraphML attribute is left
    out. A variable exported under the column's name is renamed
    `networkCanvasFinishOutcome_2`, with a `'column-renamed'` warning.

  **Architect**

  - A new protocol starts with a finish stage, in each of its languages that
    Network Canvas has text for. The Finish Screen has its own editor, for its
    mode, closing and finished text, and outcome. More Finish Screens can be
    added from the New Stage chooser, and a skip rule can end the interview at
    any of them.
  - A protocol whose finish stage is missing text in its default
    language — a new protocol in a language Network Canvas has no text for, or
    text a researcher cleared — can be edited, saved and reopened, but not
    downloaded. The stage list says so, with a link to the finish stage's
    editor, and every download is refused with the same explanation.
  - Finish stages stay together at the end of the timeline: they can be
    reordered among themselves, but dragging one above the first finish stage,
    or another stage below it, stops at that point. A protocol's only finish
    stage can't be deleted. New stages are added before the finish stages.
  - Adding a language fills in the finish stage's text in that language while
    it is still the text Network Canvas supplied.
  - Finishing a preview shows the interview's completed state, with a button to
    start the preview again. The protocol summary prints the finish stage.

  **Interviewer**

  - A finished interview shows its completed state, with an **Exit** button. The
    outcome and finish stage are saved with the session (encrypted when the
    vault is on) and exported.

  **Fresco**

  - The `/interview/finished` page is gone: a finished interview's link shows
    its completed state, including to a participant who returns to it. That
    page is sent without the interview's answers or the protocol's resources,
    and nothing on it is saved back to the interview.
  - With **Freeze Completed Interviews** off, a researcher who opens a finished
    interview can still change it, as before. With it on, they see the completed
    state.
  - Each interview's finish stage and outcome are stored and exported, and
    included in the interview API. Interviews finished before this upgrade have
    no outcome.
  - The finish request must name a finish stage of the interview's protocol and
    its outcome.
  - The cookie that limits a participant to one interview per protocol now holds
    the finished interview's id. The browser no longer lets scripts read it, and
    it is sent only over HTTPS when the session cookie is (in production, unless
    `COOKIE_SECURE` says otherwise).
  - The dashboard's progress counts the finish stage as a stage.

### Patch Changes

- 98a31e7: Widen the internal `@codaco/*` dependency ranges from exact pins to caret ranges.

### Minor Changes

- b467615: Add forward skip destinations to schema 8, shared skip evaluation, synthetic
  network generation, and the interview runtime. Hidden stages can now continue
  at a later stage or route to the interview finish screen, with live route
  recalculation, safe Back navigation, and confirmed one-screen overrides for
  unavailable stages.

  Also keep shared Select fields correctly labelled and contained when option
  labels are long. The bundled sample protocol now ends the interview when a
  participant declines consent.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8be592d: Store categorical attribute values consistently as arrays of selected option values.

  Previously the CategoricalBin interface wrote a bare scalar while CheckboxGroup / ToggleButtonGroup wrote arrays, and consumers carried bridging helpers to tolerate both shapes. Categorical attributes are now always arrays (a single selection is a one-element array), and the bridges have been removed:

  - `interview`: `CategoricalBin` writes a single-element array; the node-shape resolver, categorical sorter, and bin matcher read the array contract directly.
  - `network-query`: `EXACTLY` / `NOT` use deep equality and `OPTIONS_*` use array length — the scalar-categorical fallbacks (`categoricalEqual`, scalar `optionsLength`) are gone.
  - `network-exporters`: `isCategoricalOptionSelected` checks array membership only.
  - `shared-consts`: `VariableValue` types categorical as an array of option values.
  - `protocol-validation`: the v7→v8 migration wraps existing scalar categorical filter / skip-logic rule operands (`EXACTLY` / `NOT` / `INCLUDES` / `EXCLUDES`) in a single-element array.
  - `interview` (FamilyPedigree): the `relationshipType` edge variable (a categorical) is now written and read as a single-element array, conforming to the contract so its values export and query correctly.
  - `shared-consts`: adds the canonical `RelationshipType` type and `RELATIONSHIP_TYPE_OPTIONS`, shared between Architect (which locks the categorical edge variable's options) and the FamilyPedigree interface so they cannot drift.

  Collected interview networks holding scalar categorical values must be migrated by the host application (tracked for Fresco).

### Patch Changes

- dd13556: Fix query-predicate schema-conformance bugs found in a release audit:

  - Treat absent/undefined attributes the same as `null` for `EXISTS` / `NOT_EXISTS`.
  - Guard numeric comparison operators against null and non-numeric values: datetime values are compared chronologically, and an unanswered value is no longer coerced to `0` (so `LESS_THAN` stops wrongly matching unanswered nodes).
  - Treat an invalid `CONTAINS` / `DOES_NOT_CONTAIN` regular expression as a non-match instead of throwing (the operators remain regular-expression matches, matching the architect rule editor's regex value input).

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish to fix 1.0.0 which was published with an empty `dist/` folder. The build script's "no pending changesets" fallback excluded `@codaco/network-query`, so its build artifacts were never produced before publish.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- e31e28d: Substantial rewrite of `@codaco/network-query` with source converted to TypeScript and tests reorganized under `src/__tests__/`.
