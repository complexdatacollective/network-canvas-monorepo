# @codaco/interview

## 1.0.0-alpha.19

### Prerelease Changes

- `CategoricalBin`: comprehensive layout overhaul to fix a longstanding cluster of expanded-panel sizing and ragged-row centring bugs.
  - The expanded bin's panel is now rendered as a sibling of `.catbin-inflow` rather than inside it. The panel is `position: absolute` and anchors to `.catbin-circles`; if it sat inside `.catbin-inflow`, the size container on `.catbin-inflow` would have made that element its own containing block and `cqi` would have resolved against the (padding-shrunk) in-flow area instead of the full one.
  - Split the size query container from the grid: `.catbin-inflow` is the in-flow query container, `.catbin-grid` is the actual grid descendant where the `@container catbin` rules match and where `data-count` drives the layout lookup.
  - Drive grid layout entirely from `data-count` + CSS instead of measuring the container in JS. Drop the now-unused `useCircleLayout` hook.
  - Ragged-row centring is now keyed on a `[data-flow-index]` attribute (1-based ordinal among in-flow bins) rather than `:nth-child`, which broke whenever one bin was lifted out of the in-flow sequence to become the expanded panel.
  - Per-bin container for adaptive title + summary, so each bin's text scales to its own measured size.
  - Float `NodeDrawer` so opening/closing the drawer doesn't resize the bin area underneath.
  - Two final bugs: a panel/padding `cqi` mismatch where the same `clamp(20rem, 40cqi, 40rem)` resolved against different ancestor containers and produced a 200px gap, and a re-expand failure where Motion lost its `layoutId` transition because the expanded item had a constant React `key`.
- `AlterForm` / `AlterEdgeForm`: rebuilt around an explicit intro/form state machine with parent-owned intro navigation. Restores the scroll chain inside slides.
- `SlidesForm`: isolate fields from the hidden submit button so `not-last:mb-*` drops the bottom margin on the visually-last field.
- `useBeforeNext`: per-instance keys so multiple consumers in the same stage compose cleanly instead of clobbering each other.
- `synthetic.addVariable`: dedupe by name so callers can't shadow the auto-seeded `"name"` text variable added by `addNodeType`.
- `DataCard` polish and a saner default `basis` (50) on `Roster`.

- Intro-panel surface spacing increased and unified across stages. `Anonymisation`, `Information`, `EgoForm`, `DyadCensus`, `TieStrengthCensus`, `SlidesForm/IntroPanel`, and `NameGeneratorRoster/DataCard` get the new spacing scale. `DyadCensus` and `TieStrengthCensus` drop their local Surface wrappers in favour of the now-shared intro-panel pattern.

## 1.0.0-alpha.18

### Prerelease Changes

- `Narrative/PresetSwitcher` rebuilt on top of the fresco-ui wrappers. Switches from base-ui primitives to `Popover`/`Accordion`/`RadioItem`, adds a drag-handle button driven by `useDragControls`, and treats the popover as a pure toggle — only the trigger opens or closes it. The floating panel now uses `Surface spacing='sm'` with an explicit `shadow-xl` for the elevated/floating look, each accordion section flattens its header into a single `Trigger` that applies `headingVariants()` directly, and unused `presetLabelVariants` / `presetContentVariants` / `prevPresetRef` from the prior `AnimatePresence`-based version are removed.

- `OneToManyDyadCensus` rebuilt around the shared `Panel` + `NodeList` primitives. Replaces the hand-rolled `Surface` + `Heading` + `Collection` stack so the targets list matches the established node-list pattern (header, sizing, animation, DnD-ready). Focal source node renders at size `'md'` and collection items at `'sm'` for clearer visual hierarchy. `Panel` now forwards `className` so consumers can constrain its width. Panel title copy was also clarified.

- `DyadCensus` and `TieStrengthCensus` migrated to listbox semantics. `TieStrengthCensus` replaces `BooleanOption` with `RichSelectGroup` (horizontal listbox); `BooleanOption` is deleted. The two duplicate `Pair` components are consolidated into a single shared component with an optional SR-only `labelId`. Both stages now wire `aria-labelledby` on the response field referencing the pair label plus the `Prompts` id, so screen readers announce "Alice and Bob, [prompt], listbox, [option]" on focus arrival. `Prompts` accepts and forwards an `id` prop for these aria-labelledby targets.

- Markdown rendering fix for intro/explanation bodies. `RenderMarkdown` now receives `ALLOWED_MARKDOWN_SECTION_TAGS` so plain-text content renders inside `<p>` instead of being unwrapped, and `IntroPanel` drops the wrapping `<span>` (which was invalid markup around block content).

- Synthetic data improvements:

  - `addNodeType` now auto-adds a `'name'` text variable to every node type it creates. The existing `getNetwork` attribute-fill path already populates text variables with faker `firstNames` via `ValueGenerator`, and `getNodeLabelAttribute` already prefers a variable named `'name'`, so synthetic nodes now get realistic seed-deterministic labels in stories and tests instead of the `'Person'`-typed fallback.
  - `addStage`'s `initialNodes: number` is now `{ count, promptIndex? }`. The optional `promptIndex` resolves to a real `promptID` at `getNetwork()` time, so panel nodes carry a realistic prior promptID and the existing-panel round-trip works on every demo prompt. All in-tree callers are updated.

- Theme cascade and `Shell` consolidation:

  - Extract a `theme-base` utility (`bg-background`/`text-text`/`publish-colors`/`font-body`) and apply it inside `ThemedRegion` so descendants re-resolve themed values at the themed cascade context; `<body>` uses `theme-base` too.
  - Mount `DndStoreProvider` and the interview `Toast.Provider` inside `Shell`, so hosts no longer need to mount them. Drops the now-unused `InterviewToastViewport` and `interviewToastManager` public exports — consumers that previously imported them can delete those references.
  - `ProgressBar`, `Spinner`, `NodeBin`, and `PassphrasePrompter` switch from `rem` to `var(--theme-root-size)` so sizes scale with the theme's root size at breakpoints.
  - Indirect `--radius` through `--radius-base` so the bare `rounded` utility keeps a `var()` reference and resolves at use-site instead of snapshotting the default-theme radius at `:root`.

- Spacing/container tokens now scale with `--theme-root-size` (via `@codaco/tailwind-config@1.0.0-alpha.17`'s rebased `--spacing-base` and `--container-*`). Consequent component cleanup:

  - `Node`: drop per-breakpoint `size-XX` variants — the themed `--theme-root-size` handles it now.
  - `Collection` layouts now express `gap` in Tailwind spacing units instead of pixels; the layouts' internal pixel math for virtualization rows resolves the same `calc(N * var(--spacing-base, 0.25rem))` expression via a hidden measurement element on the container.
  - Spacing tweaks across `NodeList`, `Panel`, `Prompt`, `FamilyPedigree` placeholder/node, `NameGenerator` `QuickAddField`/`Roster`, and `OneToManyDyadCensus` to fit the new scale.
  - Bundle the `pedigree-context-menu-hint` PNG via Vite import (previously served from `/public`).

- `NodeBin` renders the SVG via `<img src>` rather than `style={{ backgroundImage: url(...) }}` on a child `<div>`. The previous inline `style` attribute was silently dropped by React under a `motion.div` parent, so the bin graphic now renders correctly during drag.

- `ResizableFlexPanel` (and the interview's flex panel callers) only applies `overflow: hidden` during collapse, so content isn't clipped at rest. Mirrors the matching fix in `@codaco/fresco-ui@2.10.0`.

- Storybook/dev fixes:

  - Repair the theme switcher: the `withTheme` decorator now also wraps stories in `ThemedRegion`, so the canvas tab reflects interview theming (regressed when `withTheme` was previously replaced with `persistTheme`).
  - Restore `data-theme-interview` on `document.body` so story padding/chrome/scrollbars render in the themed palette when stories aren't fullscreen.
  - `NameGenerator` quick-add now wires to the real codebook variable id (the synthetic's `"name"` default doesn't match the auto-generated key, which was causing `NETWORK/ADD_NODE/rejected`).
  - Storybook `viteFinal` uses `mergeConfig` and pre-bundles `d3-force` for faster cold starts on the Sociogram-bearing stories.

- Internal: adopt the `~/*` path alias via `tsconfig` paths. TypeScript 6 deprecates `baseUrl`; Vite 8 ships `resolve.tsconfigPaths`. Relative imports deeper than one directory up rewrite to `~/...`; single-up (`../foo`) and same-dir (`./foo`) imports are left untouched. The Vite rollup `external` predicate excludes `~/*` so `preserveModules` resolves the alias to relative paths in the published `dist` (no `~/` specifiers leak to consumers).
