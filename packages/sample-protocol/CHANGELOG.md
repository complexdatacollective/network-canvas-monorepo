## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- b467615: Add forward skip destinations to schema 8, shared skip evaluation, synthetic
  network generation, and the interview runtime. Hidden stages can now continue
  at a later stage or route to the interview finish screen, with live route
  recalculation, safe Back navigation, and confirmed one-screen overrides for
  unavailable stages.

  Also keep shared Select fields correctly labelled and contained when option
  labels are long. The bundled sample protocol now ends the interview when a
  participant declines consent.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 4c994ec: Re-encode the bundled video stimulus assets (H.264, CRF 24) to cut their size by
  ~88% (~16.5 MB -> ~2 MB) with no visible quality change (SSIM ~0.998). Same
  filenames, container, and codec, so consumers need no changes.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- d96450e: Bring the bundled protocols into conformance with the current schema 8 so they open in Architect without a "Protocol Validation Failed" dialog. These protocols are tagged schema version 8, so the open path skips migration and stale legacy keys are never stripped.
  - Sample Protocol: removed `size` from Information **text** items (schema 8 only allows `size` on asset items).
  - Development Protocol: removed `size` from text items, dropped the no-longer-supported `form.title` on the ego/alter/alter-edge forms, removed the unused `loop` flag on the `withSound` asset, dropped the `highlight` block from the Sociogram prompt that also created edges (the two are mutually exclusive), and renamed the venue node type's `name_variable` to `venue_name_variable` so variable record keys are unique across entity types.
