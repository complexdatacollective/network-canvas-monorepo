# @codaco/development-protocol

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- f1dbd8d: Add node shape support with variable-to-shape mapping. NodeDefinition now includes a required `shape` field with a default shape (circle, square, or diamond) and optional dynamic mapping that maps variable values to shapes. Supports discrete mappings for categorical/ordinal/boolean variables and breakpoint mappings for number/scalar variables. Renames `iconVariant` to `icon` on node definitions.
