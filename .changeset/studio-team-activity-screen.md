Let team owners and admins observe their team's immutable activity record: a permission-checked audit.list/audit.get RPC surface with sequence-cursor pagination and server-rendered event titles, and a team activity screen with category, action, actor, outcome, and date filters, Load more pagination, and an accessible per-event detail view. Members are denied with a committed, rate-limited audit.read_denied event, and events recorded by a newer Studio version render through a safe generic presentation.
