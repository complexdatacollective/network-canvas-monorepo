A relative date question anchored near either end of the calendar no longer refuses every date it offers.

A relative date question works out the dates it accepts by counting days forward and back from an anchor. With an anchor late in the calendar that count could pass the year 9999 — an anchor of 9999-12-31 accepting one day after it worked out a latest date of 10000-01-01 — and with an early anchor it could pass year zero, working out 0000-07-05 or, further back, something that was not a date at all. Neither is a date the software recognises, so the check on what a participant entered stopped comparing dates and compared plain text instead, where a five-digit year sorts before every four-digit one. Every date the question could offer was then rejected as too late, including the one the participant had just chosen. Both ends of the window now stop at the first and last dates a date field can hold.

`@codaco/shared-consts` exports `dateWithinPickerRange`, `DATE_PICKER_EARLIEST_DATE` and `DATE_PICKER_LATEST_DATE`. The field in `@codaco/fresco-ui`, the submission checks in `@codaco/interview` and the synthetic dates drawn by `@codaco/protocol-utilities` all work the window out from that one function, so the three cannot disagree about it. Questions anchored anywhere else are unaffected, and generated data for them is unchanged.
