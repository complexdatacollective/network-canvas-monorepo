Fix text in the Information interface being unselectable. It carried an `allow-text-selection` marker class meant to override the host app's global `user-select: none`, but the shared-theme migration dropped the CSS utility that implemented it (as an apparent "zero consumers" cleanup) without noticing this interface still relied on it, so the override silently stopped doing anything. Participants and researchers previewing an Information stage could not select or copy its text. Now uses Tailwind's built-in `select-text`, which restores the original behaviour by inheritance since nothing inside the interface sets its own `user-select`.
