# Release stable versions for protocol-validation

This changeset marks the transition from alpha/prerelease to stable versions for protocol-validation package.

## Changes
- **@codaco/protocol-validation**: Upgraded from `4.0.0-alpha.11` â†’ `4.0.0` (stable)

## Context
- Both shared-consts (3.0.0) and protocol-validation are now considered stable and ready for production use
- This removes the alpha/prerelease status and indicates these packages have reached production readiness

## Breaking Changes
This is not a breaking change in terms of functionality - the API remains the same. The version bump reflects the move from alpha to stable status.
