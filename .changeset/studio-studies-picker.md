Studio's study picker now lists and creates real studies instead of protocols. `/team/$teamId` shows each study with its lifecycle state, its participation mode and its wave and participant counts, and creating one writes the study and its protocol line together in a single transaction — so every study has something to design, and the creator receives the study's first Manager grant. Who sees what follows the decided role model: a team Admin or Owner sees every study their team owns, and a team Member sees only the studies they hold a study role on; creating a study is an Admin or Owner action, and a refusal is recorded in the team's activity log alongside the creation itself. A `/study/…` link now opens the study it names from any starting point — the server works out which team owns it from the study identifier alone, rather than the browser having to know, so a bookmark or a shared link opens correctly on a first sign-in that has no team selected yet. The header's study chip names the study instead of showing its identifier and offers the team's other studies, and the protocol editor reaches its draft through the study's protocol rather than treating the study identifier as a protocol identifier.
