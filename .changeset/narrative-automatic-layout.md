Unify the Sociogram and Narrative stage behaviours into a single shared schema, and flatten the `automaticLayout` behaviour to a plain boolean (was `{ enabled }`). The Narrative interface gains a configurable `automaticLayout` behaviour (a force-directed layout that positions nodes). It is only active when explicitly enabled, so existing protocols keep their hand-authored static layouts; new Narrative stages created in Architect enable it by default. The v7→v8 migration flattens any existing Sociogram `automaticLayout` value.
