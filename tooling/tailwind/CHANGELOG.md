# @codaco/tailwind-config

## 1.0.0-alpha.16

### Prerelease Changes

- Two related fixes that make the scoped interview theme actually paint correctly when `data-theme-interview` is applied to a non-root element. Without these, `bg-background` / `text-text` / etc. on descendants of the wrapper still resolved to the default-theme palette — the alpha.15 scoping work didn't actually take effect at the visible color level.

  1. **Switched the `@theme` block to the `inline` modifier.** Tailwind v4's default `@theme` registers typed tokens (colors, lengths) via `@property`, which causes `var()` references in their values to be resolved at _declaration_ time on `:root` — snapshotting the default-theme `--background` value into `--color-background`, and so on. Once the interview theme lives on a non-root wrapper, redeclaring `--background` inside `[data-theme-interview]` had no effect on the `--color-*` indirection that utilities went through. With `@theme inline`, utilities compile to `background-color: var(--background)` directly; the inner `var()` resolves at use-site so the wrapper's override flows through to descendants. Same applies to the type scale (`var(--theme-root-size)`), spacing (`var(--spacing-base)`), and any other token that uses `var()` indirection inside `@theme`.

  2. **Elevation plugin uses bare semantic tokens.** `--scoped-bg` and `--scoped-text` now point at `var(--background)` / `var(--text)` etc. instead of going through `var(--color-background)` / `var(--color-text)`. Both forms resolve to the same value at runtime under `@theme inline`, but the bare form matches what Tailwind's standard utilities now emit and decouples the elevation plugin from the `--color-*` indirection altogether.

## 1.0.0-alpha.15

### Patch Changes

- Add `./fresco/utilities.css` to the package's exports field. The file already shipped, but was missing from `exports`, so consumers (notably `@codaco/fresco-ui@2.1.0`'s compiled CSS) couldn't resolve `@codaco/tailwind-config/fresco/utilities.css` under the `style`/`production`/`import` conditions and storybook builds failed with "is not exported under the conditions".

### Prerelease Changes

- Type scale rewritten to use a `--theme-root-size` sentinel custom property; the interview theme drops the `:root` requirement and binds to `[data-theme-interview]` on any element. Responsive font-sizes now also honor user OS text-zoom (rem-based instead of px-pegged). `interview:` and `dashboard:` `@custom-variant` selectors updated to support nested coexistence — `dashboard:` uses a `:not()` chain so it correctly excludes themed regions and their descendants instead of relying on the broken `:root` negation.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c0cc415: Move the canonical Fresco themes (default + interview) into @codaco/tailwind-config.
  The previous default-theme.css was a stripped subset; it's now replaced with the
  full theme including light + dark variants and Inclusive Sans body font.
  The new interview-theme.css adds the interview-mode palette (keyed off
  :root:has([data-interview])).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f553ba7: Move the Nunito Google Fonts `@import url(...)` out of `default-theme.css` and into a new `@codaco/tailwind-config/fresco/fonts.css`. `fresco-ui`'s `styles.css` now imports it first, so the `@import` lands at the top of the CSS stream — CSS spec requires `@import` to precede all rules except `@charset` / `@layer`. Resolves the "@import rules must precede all rules" warning emitted by Tailwind v4 builds in consumer projects.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ead6f9e: Initial publish to npm. Now consumable by external apps via `@codaco/fresco-ui`'s CSS imports (`@import "@codaco/tailwind-config/fresco/theme.css"`, `@plugin "@codaco/tailwind-config/fresco/plugins/elevation/elevation"`, etc.). Tailwind v4 loads the TypeScript plugin entrypoints directly via its bundled `jiti` loader, so no build step ships compiled JS — the TS sources are published as-is.
